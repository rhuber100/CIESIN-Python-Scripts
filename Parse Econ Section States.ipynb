They play in the [[Amica Mutual Pavilion]] in Providence and won the AHL\\'s [[Calder Cup]] during the [[1998–99 AHL season]]. The other is [[Rhode Island FC]], a [[Association football|soccer]] team who will begin competing in the second tier [[USL Championship]] in 2024.\\n\\n[[File:McCoy Stadium Pan.jpg|thumb|upright=2|The [[Pawtucket Red Sox]] played at [[McCoy Stadium]]]]\\nThe [[Pawtucket Red Sox]] baseball team was a [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[International League]] affiliate of the [[Boston Red Sox]] from 1973 to 2020. They played at [[McCoy Stadium]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] and had won four league titles, the [[Governors\\' Cup]], in 1973, 1984, 2012, and 2014. McCoy Stadium also has the distinction of being home to the [[longest professional baseball game]] ever played – 33 innings.\\n\\nThe [[Providence Reds]] were a hockey team that played in the [[Canadian–American Hockey League|Canadian-American Hockey League]] (CAHL) from 1926 to 1936, and the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) from 1936 to 1977, the last season of which they played as the Rhode Island Reds. The team won the Calder Cup in 1938, 1940, 1949, and 1956. The Reds played at the Rhode Island Auditorium, on North Main Street in Providence, Rhode Island from 1926 through 1972, when the team affiliated with the New York Rangers and moved into the newly built Providence Civic Center. The team name came from the state bird, a rooster known as the Rhode Island Red. They moved to New York in 1977, then to [[Connecticut]] in 1997, and are now called the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]].\\n\\nThe Reds are the oldest continuously operating minor-league hockey franchise in North America, having fielded a team in one form or another since 1926 in the CAHL. It is also the only AHL franchise to have never missed a season. The AHL returned to Providence in 1992 in the form of the Providence Bruins.\\n\\n[[File:1884grays.jpg|thumb|1884 Baseball Champion Providence Grays]]\\nBefore the great expansion of athletic teams all over the country, Providence and Rhode Island in general played a great role in supporting teams. The [[Providence Grays]] won the first World Championship in baseball history in 1884. The team played their home games at the old Messer Street Field in Providence. The Grays played in the National League from 1878 to 1885. They defeated the New York Metropolitans of the American Association in a best of five-game series at the Polo Grounds in New York. Providence won three straight games to become the first champions in major league baseball history. [[Babe Ruth]] played for the minor league Providence Grays of 1914 and hit his only official minor league home run for them before the Grays\\' parent club, the [[Boston Red Sox|Boston Red Stockings]], recalled him.\\n\\nRhode Island has deep history with the sport of soccer where the sport was played as early as 1886 when the state\\'s first organized league would be founded, known as the Rhode Island Football Association (RIFA). One of their teams, the Pawtucket Free Wanderers, would establish themselves as a regional power and win the [[American Cup]] in 1893. The first championship game of the [[U.S. Open Cup]] was also held in 1914 in Pawtucket\\'s Coates Field to a crowd of 10,000. Later, a team known as Pawtucket Rangers F.C. would win the [[1941 National Challenge Cup|1941 edition]] of the U.S. Open Cup (then National Challenge Cup). The [[Rhode Island Oceaneers]] would later be founded, and went on to win the [[1974 American Soccer League]] championship. Other former semiprofessional soccer teams of the modern era include the [[Rhode Island Stingrays]] of the [[USL Premier Development League]], and the [[RI Reds|Rhode Island Reds]] of the [[National Premier Soccer League]], with both leagues regarded as the fourth tier of American soccer.\\n\\nThe now-defunct professional football team known as the [[Providence Steamrollers (NFL)|Providence Steamrollers]] won the 1928 NFL title.

Oregon is a part of the [[Western United States]], with the [[Columbia River]] delineating much of Oregon\\'s northern boundary with [[Washington (state)|Washington]], while the [[Snake River]] delineates much of its eastern boundary with [[Idaho]]. The [[42nd parallel north|42° north parallel]] delineates the southern boundary with [[California]] and [[Nevada]]. The western boundary is formed by the [[Pacific Ocean]].\\n\\nOregon has been home to many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] nations for thousands of years. The first European traders, explorers, and settlers began exploring what is now Oregon\\'s Pacific coast in the early to mid-16th century. As early as 1564, the [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|Spanish]] began sending vessels northeast from the [[Philippines]], riding the [[Kuroshio Current]] in a sweeping circular route across the northern part of the Pacific. In 1592, [[Juan de Fuca]] undertook detailed mapping and studies of ocean currents in the Pacific Northwest, including the Oregon coast as well as the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca|strait]] now bearing his name. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] traversed Oregon in the early 1800s, and the first permanent European settlements in Oregon were established by fur trappers and traders. In 1843, an autonomous government was formed in the [[Oregon Country]], and the [[Oregon Territory]] was created in 1848. Oregon became the 33rd state of the U.S. on February 14, 1859.\\n\\nToday, with 4.2 million people over {{convert|98000|sqmi|km2}}, Oregon is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|ninth largest]] and [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|27th most populous]] U.S. state.

The earliest evidence of the name \\'\\'Oregon\\'\\' has [[Spanish language|Spanish]] origins. The term \"orejón\" (meaning \"big ear\") comes from the historical chronicle \\'\\'Relación de la Alta y Baja California\\'\\' (1598),{{Sfn|Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes|1988|p=149}} written by Rodrigo Montezuma of [[New Spain]]; it made reference to the [[Columbia River]] when the Spanish explorers penetrated into the North American territory that became part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. This chronicle is the first topographical and linguistic source with respect to the place name \\'\\'Oregon\\'\\'. Another possible source is the Spanish word \\'\\'[[oregano]]\\'\\', which refers to a plant that grows in the southern part of the region. It is also possible that the American territory was named by the Spaniards, as there is a stream in [[Spain]] called the \"Arroyo del Oregón\" (which is located in the province of [[Ciudad Real]]), or that the \"j\" in the Spanish phrase \"El Orejón\" was later corrupted into a \"g\".{{Sfn| Johnson |1904 | p=51}}\\n\\nAnother early use of the name, spelled \\'\\'Ouragon\\'\\', was by Major [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Robert Rogers]] in a 1765 petition to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The term referred to the then-mythical River of the West (the Columbia River).

Because Oregon\\'s state budget is written in two-year increments and, there being no sales tax, state revenue is based largely on income taxes, it is often significantly over or under budget. Recent legislatures have had to be called into special sessions repeatedly to address revenue shortfalls resulting from economic downturns, bringing to a head the need for more frequent legislative sessions.

Between the 9th and 12th centuries, the region was dominated by the [[popes]], and at times was part of the [[Duchy of Spoleto]] and (partly) the [[Duchy of Benevento]]. Subsequently, the [[Normans]] took over, and Abruzzo became part of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], later the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]] took over in 1734, establishing the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in 1816, and ruled until [[Italian unification]] (also known as the Risorgimento<ref>{{Cite book |title=Italian unification, 1820–71. |last=Collier |first=Martin |publisher=Heinemann |year=2003 |isbn=9780435327545 |location=Oxford |pages=2}}</ref>) in 1860.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The regions of Italy; a reference guide |last=Domenico |first=Roy Palmer |publisher=Greenwood |year=2002 |pages=4}}</ref>\\n\\nThe administrative region of Abruzzo was formed in the 1230s, when [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] divided his realms into [[justiciarate]]s, with Abruzzo forming one of them. This was subsequently divided into \\'\\'[[Abruzzo Citra]]\\'\\' (nearer Abruzzo) and \\'\\'Abruzzo Ultra\\'\\' (farther Abruzzo), named in relation to the capital Naples,<ref name=\"Wine\" /> by [[Carlo I of Anjou]] in the 1270s, and in 1806 Abruzzo Ultra was itself divided in two (in the [[Kingdom of Naples (Napoleonic)]]), as Abruzzo Ultra I and Abruzzo Ultra II (being divided at the [[Gran Sasso d\\'Italia]]); the same Citra/Ultra I/Ultra II scheme was used for Calabria. When Abruzzo was divided into smaller regions, these were referred to collectively by the plural term \\'\\'Abruzzi\\'\\'. In the 1948 [[Italian Constitution]], these were unified with Molise into the [[Abruzzi e Molise]] region, though in the first draft Abruzzo and Molise were separate, and in 1963 Abruzzi e Molise were separated into the two regions of Abruzzo and Molise. Abruzzo Citeriore is now the [[province of Chieti]]. The [[province of Teramo]] and [[province of Pescara]] now comprise what was Abruzzo Ulteriore I. Abruzzo Ulteriore II is now the [[province of L\\'Aquila]].\\n\\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Abruzzo was on the [[Gustav Line]], part of the German\\'s [[Winter Line]]. One of the most brutal battles was the [[Battle of Ortona]]. Abruzzo was the location of two [[List of World War II prisoner-of-war camps in Italy|prisoner of war camps]], Campo 21 in Chieti,<ref>{{Cite book|title=An extraordinary Italian imprisonment : the brutal truth of Campo 21, 1942–3|last=Lett|first=Brian|publisher=Pen and Sword|year=2014|location=Barnsley}}</ref> and Campo 78 in Sulmona. The Sulmona camp also served as a POW camp in [[World War I]]; much of the facility is still intact and attracts tourists interested in [[military history]].\\n\\n==Geography==\\nGeographically, Abruzzo is nearly at the center of [[Italian peninsula]], stretching from the heart of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] to the [[Adriatic Sea]], and includes mainly mountainous and wild land. The mountainous land is occupied by a vast plateau, including [[Gran Sasso]], at {{convert|2912|m|ft}} the highest peak of the Apennines, and [[Majella|Mount Majella]] at {{convert|2793|m|ft}}. The [[Adriatic]] coastline is characterized by long sandy beaches to the North and pebbly beaches to the South. Abruzzo is well known for its landscapes and natural environment, parks and nature reserves, characteristic hillside areas rich in vineyards and olive groves. Many beaches have been awarded the [[Blue Flag beach]] status.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abruzzoturismo.it/img/depliant/en_AmbienteNatura.pdf | title=Abruzzo | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201215720/http://www.abruzzoturismo.it/img/depliant/en_AmbienteNatura.pdf | archive-date=1 February 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref>\\n\\n===Climate===\\n[[File:Lungomare giulianova.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Giulianova]] seaside]]\\n\\nIn Abruzzo there are two climatic zones. The coastal strip and [[sub-Apennine]] hills have a climate markedly different from that of the mountainous interior.  Coastal areas have a [[Mediterranean]] climate with hot dry summers and mild winters.

Along the coastal belt [[Mediterranean shrubland]] Is the dominant natural vegetation, with species like [[myrtus|myrtle]], [[ericaceae|heather]] and [[Pistacia lentiscus|mastic]]. Inland we find [[olive]], [[pine]], [[willow]], [[oak]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[alder]], [[arbutus]], [[broom]], [[acacia]], [[capers]], [[rosemary]], [[Common hawthorn|hawthorn]], [[licorice]] and [[almond]] trees, interspersed with [[oak]] trees. At elevations between {{convert|600|and|1000|m|ft}} there is [[sub-montane]] vegetation, with mixed woodlands of oak and turkey oak, maple and [[hornbeam]]; shrubs include [[dog rose]] and [[red juniper]].

The industrial sector relies on few large enterprises and the predominance of small and medium enterprises. In the [[research|applied research]] field, there are major institutes and enterprises involved in the fields of [[pharmaceutics]], [[biomedicine]], [[electronics]], [[aerospace]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The industrial infrastructure is dispersed throughout the region in industrial zones. The most important of these are: Val Pescara, Val di Sangro, Val Trigno, Val Vibrata and Conca del Fucino.\\n\\nThe [[province of Teramo]] is one of the most industrialized areas of Italy and of the region, with numerous small and medium-sized companies,<ref>[http://ricerca.gelocal.it/ilcentro/archive/ilcentro/2008/02/04/CR2PO_CR201.html Abruzzo, the number of companies grows]</ref> then follows the [[province of Chieti]] and that of [[Pescara]], which is also supported by [[tourism]]; the Val Vibrata ([[province of Teramo]]), on the border with the [[Marche]] region, is home to a myriad of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the textile and footwear sectors. The Val di Sangro (province of Chieti), on the other hand, is home to important multinationals and a factory belonging to the [[Fiat]] ([[Sevel]]) group. The area of [[Valle Peligna]] (province of L\\'Aquila) is also home to industries (the famous one of [[Sulmona]] sugared almonds), while other areas such as Pescara and Theatine are home to numerous industries, including multinationals (for example [[De Cecco]], [[Procter & Gamble]], Monti & Ambrosini Editori, Brioni, Ennedue and [[Miss Sixty]], mostly concentrated in the industrial district of Val Pescara in the province of Chieti).\\n\\n===Agriculture===\\n[[File:Centerba.jpg|right|thumb|[[Centerba]], typical liquor of Abruzzo]]\\nAgriculture, based on small holdings, has modernised and produces high-quality products. The mostly small-scale producers are active in wine, [[cereal]]s, [[sugar beet]], potatoes, olives, vegetables, fruit and [[dairy product]]s. Traditional products are [[saffron]] and [[liquorice]].

the latter is estimated at between 3 and 4 million hectoliters with the production of wines such as [[Montepulciano d\\'Abruzzo]] in the red and cerasuolo (rosé) varieties, [[Trebbiano d\\'Abruzzo]], Pecorino and the Chardonnay;

The largest province, L\\'Aquila, is situated entirely in the interior and has the lowest population density. The movement of the population of Abruzzo from the mountains to the sea has led to the almost complete urbanization of the entire coastal strip especially in the [[province of Teramo]] and Chieti. The effects on the interior have been impoverishment and demographic aging, reflected by an activity rate in the province of L\\'Aquila which is the lowest among the provinces in Abruzzo – accompanied by geological degradation as a result of the absence of conservation measures. In the coastal strip, however, there is such a jumble of accommodations and activities that the environment has been negatively affected.

It is divided into [[Municipalities of Guanajuato|46 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]]. \\n\\nIt is located  in central Mexico and is bordered by the states of [[Jalisco]] to the west, [[Zacatecas]] to the northwest, [[San Luis Potosí]] to the north, [[Querétaro]] to the east, and [[Michoacán]] to the south. It covers an area of {{convert|30,608|km2|abbr=on}}. The state is home to several historically important cities, especially those along the \"Bicentennial Route\", which retraces the path of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]\\'s insurgent army at the beginning of the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. This route begins at [[Dolores Hidalgo]], and passes through the [[Sanctuary of Atotonilco]], [[San Miguel de Allende]], [[Celaya]], and the capital of [[Guanajuato City|Guanajuato]]. Other important cities in the state include [[León, Guanajuato|León]], the state\\'s biggest city, [[Salamanca, Guanajuato|Salamanca]], and [[Irapuato]]. The first town established by the [[Spaniards]] in Guanajuato is [[Acámbaro]] while the first to be named a city is [[Salvatierra, Guanajuato|Salvatierra]].\\n\\nGuanajuato is between the arid north of the country and the lusher south, and is geographically part of the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]], the [[Mexican Plateau]]. It was initially settled by the Spanish in the 1520s due to mineral deposits found around the city of Guanajuato, but areas such as the [[Bajío]] region also became important for agriculture and livestock. Mining and agriculture were the mainstays of the state\\'s economy, but have since been eclipsed by the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]]. Guanajuato has particularly seen growth in the [[automotive industry in Mexico|automotive industry]]. The name Guanajuato comes from [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] {{lang|pua|kuanhasï juáta}} (or in older orthography \"quanax huato\"), which means \"frog hill\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718114725/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guanajuato/ \"Guanajuato\"]. \\'\\'Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México\\'\\' {{In lang|es}}.

The Sierra Madre Oriental in Guanajuato consists of the [[Sierra Gorda]] and the Sierra del Azafrán in the northeast. The Mexican Plateau extends through the center of the state. It is subdivided into various regions parted by low-lying mountain chains such as the Sierra de la Cuatralba and the Sierra de Cubo. The Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt crosses the state in the south and includes the Bajío area, the Altos de Jalisco and the valleys area in the far south. The state is crossed by several mountain ranges with mountains between 2,300 and 3,000 meters high. Mountain ranges average 2,305 meters and flat areas lie at around 1,725 meters above mean sea level. Other important mountain ranges include the Sierra Gorda to the north, the Sierra de Guanajuato in the southeast, the Comanja in the northwest and the Codorniz in the east.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\\n[[File:Matorral xerófilo de Dolores Hidalgo.jpg|thumb|Altos de Guanajuato]]\\nThe state is divided into five regions, taking into consideration geography and climate: Altos de Guanajuato, La Sierra Central, Bajío, La Sierra Gorda, and Los Valles del Sur.<ref name=\"r50\">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 50</ref> The Altos de Guanajuato, in the north, are a chain of forested mountains interspersed with pastures, small fields and areas with cacti and other desert plants. They begin near the border with San Luis Potosí, and extend south to Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende, and the Querétaro border. This area\\'s altitude varies from 1,800 meters to peaks over 2,900, such as La Giganta and La Sierra del Cubo. The climate is mostly semiarid with a rainy season in the summer, with average temperatures between 15 and 20 °C. Winter lows often reach 0 °C or lower with frosts. Wildlife is found mostly in the most rugged and inaccessible areas and includes deer, coyotes, eagles and rattlesnakes.<ref name=\"r53\">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 53</ref>\\n[[File:Cerro Culiacán from Jaral del Progreso.jpg|thumb|Cerro Culiacán from Jaral del Progreso]]\\nLa Sierra Gorda is shared between Guanajuato and Querétaro and is considered an important biosphere. This area is the most rugged in the state where most of the natural areas and small villages remain intact due to their inaccessibility.<ref name=\"r51\">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 51</ref> The Sierra Gorda is part of the Sierra Madre Occidental, with extreme variations in its geography and climate. The rugged terrain means that there are a wide number and variety of micro-climates, although average temperatures vary only between 16 and 19 °C. It lowest point is a canyon called Paso de Hormigas in [[Xichú]] at 650 meters above sea level with a very warm climate suitable for tropical fruit. The highest point is Pinal de Zamorano at 3,300 meters, followed by El Picacho de Pueblo Nuevo, El Zorillo and El Cuervo, all above 2,700 meters. The largest changes are seen in arid versus wetter zones, which can often be relatively nearby, with foliage changing from rainforest to pine forest to desert landscapes.<ref name=\"r6465\">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 64–65</ref> In 1997, the federal government declared the Sierra Gorda region in Querétaro a Biosphere Reserve, with Guanajuato\\'s portion added in 2007. On the Guanajuato side, it covers 236,882 hectares over the municipalities of Xichú, [[San Luis de la Paz]], [[Atarjea]], [[Victoria, Guanajuato|Victoria]] and [[Santa Catarina, Guanajuato|Santa Catarina]]. Culturally, the Sierra Gorda region is the far western part of [[La Huasteca]], which extends over parts of Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] and [[Veracruz]].<ref name=\"r65\">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 65</ref>\\n\\nThe Sierra Central is a series of low, gentle mountains in the center of the state that are part of the Sierra Madre Occidental. They cover 12 municipalities: [[Ocampo, Guanajuato|Ocampo]], [[San Felipe, Guanajuato|San Felipe]], León, Silao, Guanajuato, Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende, Irapuato, Salamanca, [[Santa Cruz de Juventino Rosas]], [[Comonfort, Guanajuato|Comonfort]] and [[Apaseo el Grande]]. Wild vegetation runs from tropical rainforest to arid grasslands with cactus, with cypress trees along rivers and other surface water. Wildlife includes raccoons, quail, rabbits, skunks and migratory birds. The land is productive, especially for fruit orchards producing [[guava]]s, [[tejocote]], apples, limes, [[quince]] and more. Desert fruits such as [[cactus pear]]s (tuna), garambullos and [[xoconostle]] are also produced commercially.<ref name=\"r72\">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 72</ref>\\n\\nThe state\\'s best-known geographical region is the Bajío, a relatively low and flat area of between 1,700 and 1,800 meters that surrounds the [[Lerma River]] and its tributaries.

Today, the area is the center of most of the state\\'s agriculture and industry since the terrain allows for highways and large farms, which produce grains, vegetables and fruit.<ref name=\"r76\"/> This farmland is considered some of Mexico\\'s most productive.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\\n[[File:Lake yuriria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lake Yuriria]]]]\\nLos Valles del Sur, also called the Valles Abajeños, are valleys located in southwestern Guanajuato, bordering Michoacán. This area is distinguished by the large number of [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] place names and covers the municipalities of [[Valle de Santiago]], [[Yuriria]], [[Tarimoro, Guanajuato|Tarimoro]], [[Apaseo el Alto]], [[Moroleón]], [[Uriangato]], [[Santiago Maravatío]], [[Acámbaro]], [[Jerécuaro]], [[Coroneo]] and [[Tarandacuao]]. The area is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, with elevations ranging between 1,700 and 2,000 meters. The soil is fertile due to its volcanic base, producing crops such as [[sorghum]], wheat, corn and vegetables. The land also produces building materials such as [[tezontle]] and black sandstone. In the higher elevations, there are forests of pine and holm oak but these have been much reduced by deforestation. The more arid areas have mesquite, [[nopal]] and other desert plants. There are several small lakes, the best known being [[Lake Yuriria]] as well as canyons and cave systems, some of which were used for ceremonial purposes by pre-Hispanic peoples. It is also the home the [[Siete Luminarias]] de Valle de Santiago, a set of seven inactive volcanic craters in the northwest and southwest of the Santiago Valley. The volcano cones rise abruptly out of the ground with craters up to one kilometer across. Locals call the formations \"holes\" (\\'\\'hoyos\\'\\') and they are named La Alberca, La Cíntora, Estrada, Blanca, Alvarez, Solís and Rincón de Parangueo. La Cíntora and Rincón de Parangueo contain cave paintings and evidence that people once lived in the craters. La Alberca (\"The Pool\") is a crater lake open to the public for swimming, rowing or boating. The name of Siete Luminarias (\"Seven Lanterns\") comes from an imagined prehistoric time when the seven were active at once.<ref name=\"d17\">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 17</ref>\\n\\nThe state has about 1,500 bodies of surface water, along with underground aquifers in most parts of the state. Its principal lake is [[Lake Cuitzeo]], on the border with Michoacán and the Yuriria. Several of the Siete Luminarias craters have also developed crater lakes, especially La Joya, Parangueo and Olla de Zìntora.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/> The most important river in Guanjuato and one of the most important in the country is the Lerma, along with its tributaries [[Guanajuato River]], [[Laja River (Mexico)|La Laja]], and [[Turbio River (Mexico)|Turbio]]. The Lerma river basin covers 81% of the state (center and south); the [[Pánuco River]] basin (north of the state) and Cuitzeo Lake cover the remainder.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/><ref name=\"trabajos\"/> The Lerma is regulated by various dams in part to control the fact that it ran very high in the rainy season and very low in the dry season.<ref name=\"trabajos\"/> These dams include the Ignacio Allende, la Purísima, Solís, La Gavia, Conejo II and Santa Ifigenia.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\\n[[File:Bajio.JPG|thumb|Farmland in the [[Bajío]]]]\\n\\n===Climate===\\nClimates in the state are grouped by precipitation and average temperatures into three major groups. The semiarid climate is characterized by the fact that evaporation often exceeds precipitation. Most of the vegetation in these areas is arid grassland with desert plants such as nopal. These climates cover about 40% of the state, mostly in the north. Semiarid temperate regions are found in the municipalities of San Felipe, [[San Diego de la Unión]], San Luis de la Paz, part of Dolores Hidalgo and [[San José de Iturbide]], where precipitation varies between 400 and 500 mm and the average temperature is between 16 and 18 °C. Semiarid semihot climates can be found north of Dolores Hidalgo, around León and in areas near Celaya. In these municipalities, rainfall averages between 600 and 700 mm and the average annual temperature is between 18 and 20 °C. Temperate climates are judged by the presence of holm oak and pine forest, pine forests and/or pine forests with meadows. Humidity varies in these forest regions. Temperate semi-moist areas are mostly found in the southeast municipalities of Apaseo, Coroneo and Jerécuaro and in the center of the state. Precipitation varies from 600 to 700 mm and the average temperature is between 16 and 18 °C. Temperate and somewhat humid climates have rainfall averages of between 700 and 800 mm, with temperatures between 16 and 18 °C. These can be found in [[Pénjamo]], Coroneo, Jerécuaro and parts of Guanajuato (municipality) and Dolores Hidalgo. Temperate climates with the most humidity are in Santa Rosa and municipality of Guanajuato. These have rainfall averages over 800 mm and average temperatures under 16 °C. Hot and moist climates in the state have temperatures ranging from 18 to 22 °C and are associated with tropical rainforest, with some grassland. These climates are subdivided into two types, one that receives less rainfall with a significant dry season and one that is wetter. The drier type is found in Abasolo, Irapuato, Salamanca and [[Romita]]. In total, these hot and relatively moist climates can be found in about 40% of the state.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\\n\\n===Ecology===\\nFrom the beginning of the colonial period, much of Guanajato\\'s environment suffered greatly from the mining techniques and intensive agriculture the Spanish introduced. The process has been ongoing since then to modern times. Before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest]], the state was covered in forests, but mining requires large amounts of fuel to process minerals, so they were cut down for fuel and construction projects. Agriculture leached nutrients from the soil, caused erosion, and introduced plants, animals and diseases that have had a large impact.<ref name=\"r52\">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 52</ref>\\n\\nToday, the state contains 21 protected areas that extend over 63,611 hectares in 26 municipalities. These include [[Sierra de Lobos]], [[Siete Luminarias]], the Silva Dam, Megaparque de Dolores Hidalgo, Cuenca de la Esperanza, Las Fuentes, Peña Alta, Pinal de Zamorano, Parque Metropolitano, La Joya Crater, [[Lake Yuriria]], Las Musas, Culiacán and La Gavia Mountains, [[Sierra de los Agustinos]], [[Sierra de Pénjamo]], Cerro de Cubilete, Cerro de Amoles, La Purisima Dam, Arandas Mountain, La Soledad Dam, and the upper basin of the Temascatío River. Another protected area is the [[Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve]]. In Guanajuato, it extends over 236,882 hectares and contains 182 bird species, 42 mammal species and 84 plant species, including two recently discovered ones, \\'\\'[[Beaucamea compacta]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[Calibanus glassianus]]\\'\\'. The park contains a number of species in danger of extinction, including the black bear and the [[Cougar|puma]]. The climate is semiarid with variations in temperature due to altitude changes, but most of the area is covered in tropical forest in which many plants lose leaves during the dry season from November to May.<ref name=\"r51\"/>\\n\\n<div align=center>\\n<!-- galería de mapas -->\\n{| class=\"toc\" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=800px style=\"float:center; margin: 0.5em 0.5em 0.5em 1em; padding: 0.5e\"\\n|colspan=8 style=\"background:#green; color:white; font-size:100%\" align=center bgcolor=\"green\"|\\'\\'\\'Flora and fauna of Guanajuato\\'\\'\\'\\n|-\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:MountainLion.jpg|120px]]\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Crotalus aquilus.jpg|125px]]\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Ardilla gris mexicana.JPG|120px]]\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Granger Lake 013.jpg|120px]]\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Cardinal.jpg|120px]]\\n|-\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Puma concolor]]\\'\\'\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Crotalus aquilus]]\\'\\'\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Sciurus aureogaster]]\\'\\'\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Dasypus novemcinctus]]\\'\\'\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Cardinalis cardinalis]]\\'\\'\\n|-\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Turkey Vulture Closeup.jpg|120px]]\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Wtdfishwild.jpg|120px]]\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Mexican Jay Aphelocoma wollweberi 3.jpg|120px]]\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Collared Peccary in Paignton Zoo.jpg|120px]]\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Bobcat photo.jpg|120px]]\\n|-\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Cathartes aura]]\\'\\'\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Odocoileus virginianus]]\\'\\'\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Aphelocoma wollweberi]]\\'\\'\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Dicotyles tajacu]]\\'\\'\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Lynx rufus]]\\'\\'\\n|-\\n|-\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:2014-06-23 14 40 42 Aspens along the Changing Canyon Nature Trail in Lamoille Canyon, Nevada.JPG|120px]]\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Figuiers de Babarie-Ountia ficus-Fleur R-20130631.jpg|130px]]\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Echeveria agavoides (red).jpg|120px]]\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Mammillaria duwei flower.jpg|120px]]\\n|align=center valign=center bgcolor=\"white\"|[[File:Montezuma Pine at Sheffield Park.jpg|115px]]\\n|-\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Populus tremuloides]]\\'\\'\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Opuntia ficus-indica]]\\'\\'\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Echeveria agavoides]]\\'\\'\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Mammillaria duwei]]\\'\\'\\n|style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" align=center|\\'\\'[[Pinus montezumae]]\\'\\'\\n|-\\n|}\\n</div>\\n\\n==History==\\n\\n===Pre-Hispanic era===\\n[[File:Chupicuaro statuette Louvre 70-1998-3-1.jpg|thumb|[[Chupícuaro (archaeological site)|Chupícuaro]] statuette at the [[Louvre]]]]\\n\\nIn the pre-Hispanic era, the Bajio saw the most human development due to the fertility of the soil and the presence of surface water for agriculture.<ref name=\"trabajos\"/> The oldest group to inhabit the area were the people now known as the Chupícuarios, who dominated the center of the Bajío area and were active between 800 BCE and 300 CE.<ref name=\"r30\"/><ref name=\"arqueomex\">{{cite web |url= http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nArqueologia92.html |author= Beatriz Braniff C. |title= Guanajuato en la historia |year= 1993 |work= Arqueologia Mexicana |publisher= Editorial Raíces S.A. de C.V. |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Guanajuato in history |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101127035803/http://arqueomex.com/S2N3nArqueologia92.html |archive-date= November 27, 2010 }}</ref> Their largest city is now the site called [[Chupícuaro (archaeological site)|Chupícuaro]], and their influence was widespread being found in the modern states of Zacatecas, Querétaro, [[Colima]], [[Nayarit]], Hidalgo, State of Mexico, Michoacán and [[Guerrero]].

These nomadic indigenous groups are generically referred to as Chichimeca, but in reality they were a variety of ethnicities such as the [[Guachichiles]], [[Chichimeca Jonaz people|Chichimeca Jonaz]] and [[Guamare]]s. These groups were warlike, semi nomadic and did not practice significant agriculture, nor did they construct cities.<ref name=\"r30\"/> Part of the state was also inhabited by the [[Otomi]] but they were mostly displaced or dominated by the [[Purépecha]] in the southwest and the Chichimeca in other parts.<ref name=\"nomenclatura\"/> By the 16th century, most of [[Mesoamerica]] was dominated by either the [[Aztec Empire]] or [[Purépecha Empire]], but Guanajuato was under the control of neither. It was on the northern border of the Purépecha Empire with southern Guanajuato showing significant cultural influence in the southern valleys, and Aztecs had ventured into the area looking for minerals. However, most of the state was dominated by various Chichimeca tribes as part of what the Spanish would call the \"Gran Chichimeca\". These Chichimeca were mostly nomadic with some scattered agricultural communities, mostly in the north.<ref name=\"arqueomex\"/>\\n\\n=== Spanish colonial period ===\\n[[File:Convento san agustin 1.jpg|thumb|left|San Agustín de Yuriria Convent, founded by the [[Augustinians]] in 1550.]]\\n[[File:Hacienda jaral de berrios.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jaral de Berrios]], one of the most important [[hacienda]]s of the colonial era.]]\\n\\nAs the area of Guanajuato lies on the boundary of the arid north of Mexico, at first relatively few Spanish came to settle - as opposed to points south, which had much more abundant rainfall and indigenous labor.<ref name=\"arqueomex\"/> The first Spanish expedition to visit the Guanajuato area, led by [[Cristóbal de Olid]] in 1522, arrived in the Yuririhapúndaro and Pénjamo areas.

The Spanish were unable to force the natives of this area (unlike the more settled [[indigenous peoples]]) to work, and brought African slaves and indigenous peoples from other areas to work the [[hacienda]]s and mines.<ref name=\"r3031\">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 30–31</ref> The colonization efforts in the eastern part of the state began in 1542 when Spanish land-grants were issued for the Apaseo and [[Chamácuaro]] areas. In 1555 [[San Miguel de Allende|San Miguel el Grande]] was founded to protect roads linking mining camps and cities with Mexico City to the south-east. The [[León, Guanajuato|Villa de León]] was founded in 1576 to counter attacks by the indigenous peoples. But through the first centuries of the colonial period, the city of Guanajuato dominated because of its mines.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> The official name of the state is \\'\\'Guanajuato, Estado Libre y Soberano\\'\\' (Guanajuato, Free and Sovereign State). \"Guanajuato\" comes from Purépecha \\'\\'Quanaxhuato\\'\\', which has been translated as both \"place of frogs\" and \"places of many hills\". The coat of arms of the state is that of the city of Guanajuato, as granted by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor |Carlos I of Spain]]<ref name=\"nomenclatura\"/> ({{reign | 1516 | 1556}}).\\n\\nIn 1590 the Villa de San Luis de la Paz was founded and named after the peace (\\'\\'paz\\'\\') treaty between the Spanish and the Chichimeca.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> With the Spanish occupying most of the most productive land and its resources, the indigenous of the area became extremely impoverished. This eventually allowed the Spanish to negotiate peace with chiefs in exchange for basic goods such as blankets, clothes and food. This would bring temporary truces. [[Evangelization]] efforts would bring longer-term submission. [[Franciscans]] and [[Augustinians]] worked to gradually modify the worldview of the Chichimecas and others until many moved out of the mountains and into other settlements and professed, at least nominally, the Catholic faith. However, the indigenous remained extremely marginalized and poor, losing both their language and their culture until most eventually intermarried with outsiders to produce [[mestizos]].<ref name=\"r31\">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 31</ref>\\nThrough the Spanish colonial period, most of the area\\'s wealth came from mining, with much of the agriculture springing up to support the mining communities. The height of mining came in the 18th century, mostly from the mines in the hills around the city of Guanajuato, leading to the construction of a large number of notable civil and religious buildings in the same area.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> The extremely fertile Bajío area became a major agricultural area for [[New Spain]]. Both mining and agriculture brought in more Spanish and [[Criollo people|Criollos]] to take advantage, as well as mestizos and some African slaves to work the mines and fields, making the area\\'s population grow rapidly and eventually concentrate in urban centers.<ref name=\"r31\"/> The area became an [[Intendant|intendancy]] ({{lang-es | intendencia}}) or province in 1786, when the authorities divided New Spain into twelve parts.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\\n\\n===Independence and 19th century===\\n[[File:Nebel Voyage 32 Guanajuato.jpg|thumb|\\'\\'Plaza Mayor de Guanajuato\\'\\', view of the main square of [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], c. 1836 [[Carl Nebel]]]]\\nDespite the riches the area produced, most lived in oppression and poverty at the end of the 18th century, working on haciendas and in mines while a few, mostly European-born Spaniards, lived in opulence. Not only the indigenous, mestizo and Negro slaves were having problems with the social order. Many Criollos or New World-born Spanish were marginalized by the Spain-born.<ref name=\"r31\" /> One of the first rebellions against colonial rule came in 1766, when a group attacked the Caja Real in Guanajuato city to protest high taxes. In 1767, there were protests against the expulsion of the [[Jesuits]] by the [[Spanish Crown]].

In that year, a group consisting of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], [[Ignacio Allende]], [[Juan Aldama]], [[Miguel Domínguez]] and more, began to plan an armed revolt against the colonial government.

Military commanders [[Luis de Cortázar]] and [[Anastasio Bustamante]] joined forces with [[Agustín de Iturbide]] and took the city of Guanajuato on 8 July 1821, declaring the entire state independent of Spanish rule. In 1824, Guanajuato was officially proclaimed a state of Mexico by the Constitutional Congress of Mexico.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" />\\n[[File:Trolley passing in front of the San Diego Church in Guanajuato, Mexico (1907).jpg|thumb|upright|Trolley passing in front of the San Diego Church in Guanajuato, 1907]]\\n\\nThe years after the end of the War of Independence were extremely unstable, and would continue to be unstable through most of the rest of the 19th century. Dolores and San Miguel adopted the names of Dolores Hidalgo and San Miguel de Allende in honor of those who began the independence movement and in 1826, the first constitution of the state of Guanajuato was adopted.<ref name=\"r32\" /> Like much of the rest of the country, Guanajuato was affected by the prolonged fighting between Liberal and Conservative factions as well as the foreign incursions that dominated the 19th century. Guanajuato\\'s status vacillated between state (when Liberals were in charge) and department (when Conservatives held the upper hand). Under Liberal ideals, educational institutions such as the Colegio de la Santisima Trinidad and the Colegio de la Purisima Concepción were secularized and under control of the State.<ref name=\"r32\" /> In 1847, General [[Gabriel Valencia]] raised an army of 6,000 men to fight the [[Mexican–American War|U.S. invasion of Mexico]]. In 1848, in opposition to the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], General Marian Paredes, General [[Manuel Doblado]] and priest [[Celedonio Dómeco de Jarauta]] revolted, taking the state capital, but they were defeated and Domeco was executed by firing squad.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" /> In 1855, Conservative Manuel Doblado, then the governor of Guanajuato, forced [[Juan Álvarez]] out of the presidency after he took power from [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]].<ref name=\"r32\" /> In 1858, the government under President [[Benito Juárez]] moved from Mexico City to the city of Guanajuato before moving again to [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]] and then [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] during the [[Reform War]]. During this three-year period, the state would vacillate various times between the Liberals and Conservatives. In 1863, it was taken over by the French as they installed [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as emperor of Mexico. Maximillian did not reign long but the governor he appointed for Guanajuato, [[Florencio Antillón]] remained in Guanajuato until 1877.<ref name=\"enchistoria\" />\\n\\n===Mexican Revolution to the present===\\nThe situation stabilized over much of the government of Porfirio Díaz at the end of the 19th century and the economy improved, but the Diaz government was oppressive. Diaz installed [[Francisco Mena]] as governor of the state, who made a fortune through the concession of railway lines which were being built to modernize the country. Even though slavery was officially abolished during the War of Independence, most laborers in farms and mines were extremely underpaid and in a number of cases not paid at all. Agricultural production reached a peak at the end of the 19th century, earning the state the nickname of the \"granary of the Republic\". Industrialization took hold in cities such as [[León, Guanajuato|León]], [[Salvatierra, Guanajuato|Salvatierra]], [[Celaya]] and [[San Francisco del Rincón]], making shoes, textiles and hats.<ref name=\"r3233\">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 32–33</ref> One battle of the [[Mexican Revolution]] occurred in Celaya in 1915 between the troops of [[Álvaro Obregón]] and [[Francisco Villa]].<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> Many from the state fought and died in other parts of Mexico, leaving behind widows and children.

However, the ethnically indigenous population is about 10,347 (2005) or 2.6% of the population over the age of five. The languages spoken are [[Chichimeca Jonaz language|Chichimeca Jonaz]], [[Otomi language|Otomi]] and [[Nahuatl]].<ref name=\"perfilsoc\"/> The two most important indigenous groups are the [[Chichimeca Jonaz people|Chichimeca Jonaz]] and the [[Otomi people|Otomi]], both of which are concentrated in the Valles de Sur area. Culturally, both groups show significant Purépecha influence. Both live in arid regions, where rainfall is precious and the diet includes foods such as [[pitaya]]s, [[Myrtillocactus geometrizans]] (garambullo), cactus pear, nopal and [[agave]]. Hunting was an important source of protein but the scarcity of game has all but extinguished this practice. Subsistence agriculture forms the basis of the economy and provides much of the current diet. However, these peoples are extremely poor, and many migrate to other places to find work.<ref name=\"r1819\">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 18–19</ref>\\nIn what is now the state of Guanajuato, there were a number [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]) groups who built cities in the first millennium CE. but then abandoned them long before the arrival of the Spanish.<ref name=\"r18\">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 18</ref> It is believed that the Chichimeca came to dominate the area after the fall of these cities, and the Chichimeca Jonaz believe that the eagle, which is sacred to them, led them here.<ref name=\"r30\">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 30</ref> At the time of the Spanish conquest, the only Chichimeca group left were the Chichimeca Jonaz, who were semi-nomadic and warlike.

Their language is [[Oto-Pamean languages|Oto-Pamean]] and related to their neighbors, the Otomi. Most Chichimecas are found in the municipality of San Luis de la Paz, in the community of Rancho Uza or Mision Chichimeca. This community subdivides into the Mision de Abajo in the east and Mision de Arriba in the west. This area borders lands of the Huasteca and [[Pame people|Pame]] groups, and there have been conflicts among the three.<ref name=\"r18\"/> The Chichimeca Jonaz have a mixed Catholic-indigenous belief system. While outwardly Catholic, many rituals still follow the cycles found in nature, such as planting and harvesting and lunar cycles. The most important \"spirit guides\" are the eagle and water, with the Virgin of Guadalupe playing an important role as Universal Mother. One important saint is [[Isidore the Laborer]], who is connected to the bringing of rain.<ref name=\"r1819\"/>\\n\\nThe Otomis of the state are concentrated in the community of Cieneguilla in the municipality of [[Tierra Blanca, Guanajuato|Tierra Blanca]]. In pre-Hispanic times, these people were semi-nomadic, desert dwellers. During the Conquest, these and other Otomi groups allied themselves with the Spanish, in part because the Aztecs and others considered the Otomi to be backwards and barbaric. The Otomi also speak an Oto-Pamean language and are related to other Otomi groups scattered around the central and southern areas of Mexico. Today, however, most children are not learning the language from their parents, putting it in danger of extinction in spite of efforts to introduce bilingual education.<ref name=\"r1920\">Jimenez

Most clay is extracted from the Dolores Hidalgo region and most is produced in Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende and the city of Guanajuato.<ref name=\"r4243\">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 42–43</ref> Another area noted for its work is Tarandacuaro, which makes high-fire ceramics. The two best-known workshops are Fabrica Javier Servin and Taller Checuan. The ceramics of this area have distinctive, very intricate, mostly geometric designs, which are painted on by hand. The municipality promotes the work through its Centro Turistico de Desarrollo de Tarandacuao.<ref name=\"d39\">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 39</ref>\\n\\nAcámbaro is noted for its bread. The city has two well-known bakeries by the name of Panificadora Loaeza and La Antigua Panificadora El Triunfo. One local bread specialty is the \\'\\'tallado\\'\\', which has a base of egg and butter and can have fillings such as [[Common fig|fig]], coconut, raisins and chocolate. This bread is the result of recipes brought by the [[Franciscans]], modified over time by the native indigenous potters’ community.<ref name=\"d38\">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 38</ref>\\n\\n[[San Francisco del Rincón]] has had a tradition of making hats since the 18th century. Traditionally, the hats were made from palm fronds brought from the Michoacán coast area, but today many workshops and factories use synthetic fibers. In traditional workshops, the work is divided by sex, with women weaving the fibers together and men pressing it into shape, putting in the supports and other details. The quality of the hats made here has made them exportable.<ref name=\"r44\">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 44</ref>\\n\\nIn San Luis de la Paz and Coroneo, wool is worked into clothing, especially into coats, gloves, vests, scarves and other items for winter wear. Some of the workshops still work with large old weaving looms. In addition, there are workshops which make rugs, [[zarape]]s, and other items for the home.<ref name=\"r44\"/> In Coroneo, the craft 100 years ago was practiced only by women. The most common item is still the zarape, which is decorated with figures such as horse heads and deer as well as fretwork on the edges. However, sweaters, capes, [[rebozo]]s, bags and even wool shoes can also be found for sale. One other specialty is rugs woven on large looms.<ref name=\"d39\"/>\\n\\nApaseo el Alto is known for its work in fine woods, which began with the workshop of Domingo Garcia sixty years ago. Since then, about 150 workshops have been established in the municipality, employing about 500 craftsmen. Items include sculptures such as religious figures and animals and utilitarian items such as utensils and furniture. Craftsmen first began working with a wood called \"patol\" and [[juniper]], but today they work with various woods such as walnut, [[Cedar wood|cedar]], [[mahogany]] and \\'\\'[[Ceiba pentandra]]\\'\\' (the kapok).<ref name=\"d40\">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 40</ref><ref name=\"r4344\">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 43–44</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Celaya-bola.jpg|thumbnail|left|The \\'\\'bola de agua\\'\\' in Celaya; the [[water tower]] is an icon of the city.]]\\nCelaya is known in much of Mexico for its [[cajeta]], a kind of spreadable caramel, often made with goat\\'s milk, sugar and cinnamon. The mixture can be eaten straight from a spoon or used in a variety of recipes. The best known outlet for cajeta in the city is Cajetas La Tradicional, which has been in business for over 70 years.<ref name=\"d40\"/>\\n\\nMetalworking can mostly be found in the communities of Guanajuato and Salamanca. Although the capital\\'s mines no longer produce large quantities of gold and silver, silver items are still made and sold in the city. Wrought iron work for doors, windows and railings are also a specialty in certain areas of the city. Oxidized bronze items are a specialty of Salamanca, producing mostly decorative items.<ref name=\"r43\">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 43</ref> Most of the items made in Guanajuato city are still done Baroque style and sold in the city center.<ref name=\"d4345\">Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 43–45</ref> Pénjamo is one of very few places outside of the state of Jalisco to produce [[tequila]]. It is the home of the [[Tequila Corralejo]] brand, which is still made on the now former hacienda of Corralejo. The installation gives tours and has a museum called the Museo del Vino y la Botellas (Museum of Spirits and Bottles). The museum contains a collection of about 3,000 bottles, almost all of which with their original contents. Nearby is the factory that makes the distinctive blue bottles of this brand.<ref name=\"d44\">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 44</ref>\\n\\nGlass making was brought to Mexico during the early colonial period. Most items made in Guanajuato are single-colored items in blue, green, yellow and red. San Miguel de Allende has the best-known tradition where curiously shaped bottles, vases, glass sets and small cups for tequila are produced.<ref name=\"r44\"/> Wax candles and other items are a specialty in Salamanca, where they are especially in demand during [[Holy Week]].<ref name=\"r43\"/> Comonfort is known for the making of [[molcajete]]s from volcanic stone, and San Miguel is known for figures and other items made from brass. Dolores Hidalgo is known for ice cream and ices, much of which is simply sold next to the parish church. Flavors include [[sapote]], mango, honey, [[aloe]], tequila and banana.<ref name=\"d41\">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 41</ref>\\n\\nMining, manufacturing and construction accounts for over 27% of the state\\'s GDP.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> Mining is a traditional economic activity for the state, with deposits making it one of the world\\'s richest areas in the past. However, in comparison gold and silver ores are mostly depleted today.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/> Gold and silver ore is still mined with silver still the major ore produced, followed by gold, lead, copper, [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]]. Most employed in mining are still related to metals rather than non-metals.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> Other products being mined or being studied are [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[tin]], [[copper]], [[lead]], sand, [[fluorite]], [[feldspar]], lime, [[kaolin]], and more.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\\n\\n===Agriculture===\\nWhile the agricultural sector, which includes crops, livestock, fishing and forestry activities, accounts for only 4.6% of Guanajuato\\'s current GDP, the sector is an important part of the state\\'s identity and is still a major producer of a number of items nationally.<ref name=\"iplaneg\"/><ref name=\"actecon\"/> The state has 1.1 million hectares suitable for agriculture, over 36% of the state\\'s territory.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/> Over {{convert|659,000|ha}} of land is under cultivation, with the main crops being corn, sorghum, beans, wheat, barley and broccoli.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> Today, the Bajio is still one of the major grain producing regions in Mexico.<ref name=\"trabajos\"/> Certain areas of the state have large orchards producing peaches, strawberries, cactus pear, avocado, grapes, apples, quince, walnuts, apricots and guava.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\\n\\nLivestock raising is an important economic activity and can be found in all parts of the state, with animals such cattle, pigs, goats, sheep and domestic fowl,<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/> with {{convert|1,451,478|ha}} hectares dedicated to this activity.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> The Los Altos and Bajío are the state\\'s livestock producing regions, especially dairy cows.

Fishing is not a major economic activity as it is limited to the small rivers and lakes of the region. Of the two major lakes, one is shared with neighboring Michoacán state. Of the fish is that is caught or raised, most is [[carp]], followed by [[mojarra]].<ref name=\"actecon\"/> There are 150,000 hectares of forest in the state, which about half theoretically exploitable. However, forests in this state have been historically depleted with species such as holm oak, pine and [[oyamel]] in danger of extinction.

Within the state, there are about seventy hotels ranked as four or five stars.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> The three main cities for tourism are the capital city of Guanajuato, San Miguel de Allende and Dolores Hidalgo. Guanajuato is visited for its colonial architecture and its role in Mexico\\'s history, especially during the [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]]. Similarly, San Miguel has cultural and historical value. Both have been designated World Heritage Sites. Although not a World Heritage Site, Dolores Hidalgo is particularly important as the site as it is where Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla gave the cry called \"El Grito\" which began the War of Independence.<ref name=\"atractivos\">{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Atractivos Culturales y Turísticos |year= 2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Cultural and Tourist Attractions |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120327111429/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |archive-date= March 27, 2012 }}</ref>\\n\\nThe state has set up tourist routes such as the Ruta de Independencia, Ruta de Aventura (Aventure Route), Ruta Arqueológica (Archeological Route), Ruta de los Conventos (Monastery Route) and Ruta Artesanal (Handcrafts Route). The Ruta de la Independencia or Independence Route comprises ten municipalities through which the insurgent army under Miguel Hidalgo passed. These include San Miguel de Allende, Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, León, Irapuato, Pénjamo, Salamanca, Celaya, [[Salvatierra, Guanajuato|Salvatierra]] and Acámbaro. In preparation for the Bicentennial of Mexico\\'s independence, the state rehabilitated and marked the sites in which the significant historic events occurred in each of these locations.<ref name=\"d7\">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 7</ref>\\n\\nThe Ruta de Aventura connects ghost towns and abandoned mines with natural areas for hiking, mountain biking and ATV as well as other extreme sports such as [[paragliding]]. One of the ghost towns is Mineral de Pozos in the northeast of the state. The town still has its cobblestone streets with names such as Relámpago (lightning), Estrellas (stars) and Flores (Flowers). The houses here are abandoned, many in ruins and none with roofs. The town reached its height during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was called Ciudad Porfirio Díaz, but the mines later gave out and the population left. In 1982, the town was declared a Historic Monument Zone. Although no one lives there, tourism keeps a few businesses alive around the main square such as the Pozos cantina, which exhibits photographs and other memorabilia on its walls. Outside the town is the Santa Brigida mine which sustained the town until it gave out. It is marked by three large ovens with tall pyramid roofs. These were constructed by the Jesuits to work ore from the mine.<ref name=\"d1213\">Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 12–13</ref> The Ruta Arqueológica (Archeological Route) links the two pre-Hispanic sites of Plazuelas and Peralta which are currently open to visitors with two others which are scheduled to be opened sometime in the future: La Virgen de la Cañada in San Miguel de Allende and El Cóporo in Ocampo.<ref name=\"d2223\">Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 22–23</ref>\\n\\nThe Ruta de los Conventos or Monastery Route is concentrated in the south of the state, where a number of large religious complexes were built in the early colonial period for evangelization purposes. The Agustino de San Pablo Church and Monastery is located in Yuriria founded by the [[Augustinians]] who arrived from Michoacán in the 16th century. It is a monumental fortress-like construction designed by Friar Diego de Chávez y Alvarado and Pedro del Toro and constructed in an area with relatively little population. The monastery became a center from which missionaries would be trained and then sent forth and its size and battlements helped to protect it from [[Chichimeca]] attacks. The church retains its original function and [[Plateresque]] facade, but the monastery area has been converted into a museum. The Las Capucinas Church and Convent is in Salvatierra and is one of only three complexes built for nuns in the entire state during the colonial period. It has a fortress like appearance and its construction is attributed to Joaquin de Heredia, of the [[San Carlos Academy]]. During the [[Porfirio Díaz]] presidency, the convent was used as a Civil Hospital and later as a school, which still remains with the name of Colegio José María Morelos. The San Francisco Church and Monastery is in Acámbaro and built between 1734 and 1743. Its facade is [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] of light pink stone. Inside, the church contains one of the most notable main altars in the Bajio region. It is Neoclassical built of gray and pink stone with gilded details, with an image of the Virgen María Refugio de Pecadores (Virgin Mary Refuge of Sinners), which is replica of an image in [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]].<ref name=\"d30\">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 30</ref>\\n\\nThe Ruta Artesanal (Handcrafts Route) connects a number of municipalities which specialize in one or more handcrafted items, including food. These include Acámbaro, noted for its bread, Coroneo for its wool items and Tarancuaro for ceramics.<ref name=\"d38\"/>\\n\\nThe state also has a large number of water parks and thermal springs converted into water parks. Some of these include El Trébol, Villa Gasco and Comanjilla near León, Caldera Abasolo near Irapuato and Abasolo and Los Arcos and Agua Caliente near Celaya.<ref name=\"mexdesstate\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/guanajuato1.html |title= Guanajuato |publisher= Mexico Deconocido magazine |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Guanajuato |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100925022435/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/guanajuato1.html |archive-date= September 25, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\\n{{Clear}}\\n\\n==Culture==\\n\\n===Festivals===\\n[[File:Viacrucis in Santa Ana.jpg|thumbnail|[[Stations of the Cross|Viacrucis]] in Santa Ana, Guanajuato]]\\nCulturally, the state is best known for the annual [[Festival Internacional Cervantino]], which takes place in the city of Guanajuato and some other affiliated venues in the state.

This is most popular in upscale restaurants in San Miguel de Allende and Guanajuato and can include dishes such as tuna with chili peppers and duck with mesquite honey.<ref name=\"d3435\"/>\\n\\nThe state is better known as the producer of a number of food products such as cajeta, bread, candy, and ice cream. The best-known food product is \\'\\'cajeta\\'\\', a soft, spreadable sweet product made with goat\\'s milk, sugar, and flavorings. The best known place for this is Celaya. The cajeta can be flavored with vanilla, coconut, strawberry, and others; it is eaten with a spoon from the container, spread on bread, or made into candies. Another typical sweet in the state is called [[charamuscas]]. It is made with [[piloncillo]], which is melted to form shapes. In the city of Guanajuato, one can find charamuscas in the shape of mummies. Alfeñique refers to glass sugar based candies used to form figures and is most popular for [[Day of the Dead]]. Chilacayote is a candy made from a type of [[Chilacayote|melon of the same name]], which is prepared by soaking pieces of the fruit in sugar solution. Handmade ice cream is a specialty of Dolores Hidalgo, made with all natural ingredients, often using recipes passed down for generations. While ice cream and ices are made in other parts of the state, these stand out because of the many unusual flavors offered such as beer, [[pulque]], [[chile relleno]], even shrimp and [[mole (sauce)|mole]]. <!--(rincones45) --> The Franciscans taught the indigenous how to work with wheat and bake bread. Because there had already been a tradition of kneading clay for pottery, the kneading and baking of wheat bread became established quickly, adapting the original recipes to local tastes. The best known breads are those from Acámbaro, especially the type called \"pan grande\". Other well-known types are pan ranchero, tallado, pan huevo and pan leche. The first indigenous master baker in Guanajuato was Abraham de Silva Cuín, who, in 1526, began to make breads in unique forms and flavors.<ref name=\"r45\"/>\\n\\n===Architecture===\\n{{Multiple image\\n | align = left\\n | direction = vertical\\n | width =  225\\n | image1 = Tunel en Guanajuato.jpg\\n | caption1 = Entrance to a tunnel in the city of Guanajuato\\n | image2 = Dam at Jalpa de Canovas 2.jpg\\n | caption2 = Detail of the dam of [[Jalpa de Cánovas]], [[Purísima del Rincón]] designed by [[British Mexican|British-Mexican]] architect {{Interlanguage link multi|Luis Long|es}}.\\n}}\\n\\nMost of the state\\'s architecturally significant buildings are in Mexican Baroque style, especially in the capital city. This was because the mines of the state were at maximum production during the 18th century, when this style was fashionable. It can be found in mansions and civil buildings of that time but the most ornate examples are churches, with intricate facades and altarpieces both which often use the \"estipite\" column (inverted, truncated pyramid). A number of Baroque [[altarpiece]]s from this time are also gilded with gold from local mines.<ref name=\"r13\">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 13</ref> Within the city of Guanajuato, the most notable examples are the San Cayetano or La Valenciana Church, the Basilica of Guanajuato, the Temple of the Company of Jesus and the San Roque Church. Outside the capital, notable examples include the Parish of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores, the La Tercera Orden Temple and the Casa de Visitas in Dolores Hidalgo, the San Francisco Church and Monastery and the San Agustin Church in Celaya, and the Basilica Cathedral and the Nuestra Señora de los Angeles Church in León. There are some examples were the Baroque also contains indigenous elements such as the San José Church in Irapuato and the San Agustin Monastery and Church in Yuriria. At the beginning of the 19th century, Baroque was giving way to Neoclassical. The [[Mexican War of Independence]] ended most major constructions, but in many churches in the state, Baroque altarpieces were replaced with Neoclassical ones. A few [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical constructions]] did manage to be built, mostly by [[Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras]] and include the [[obelisk]] monument to [[Charles IV of Spain]], the Del Carmen Church, The San Agustin Tower and the Dolores Chapel. Neoclassical works by others include the Entrance Arch of León, the [[Teatro Principal (Guanajuato)|Teatro Principal]] in Guanajuato and the Santiago Apostól Parish in Silao. From the 19th century on, trends became more modern with one notable exception. The Parish of San Miguel in San Miguel Allende had its facade redone by self-taught architect Zeferino Gutierrez. Working from only images from postcards of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedrals in Europe, Gutierrez created the imposing Gothic-like front, which is unique in the state.<ref name=\"r1314\">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 13–14</ref>\\n\\nThe uniqueness of the state of Guanajuato even led Disney\\'s [[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]] team to be inspired by the city.

Rivera was born in the city of Guanajuato and spent his early childhood there. When he was older, he moved to Mexico City to study painting and eventually became one of Mexico\\'s most famous muralists. José Chávez Morado was a prolific painter who lived and worked in the city of Guanajuato. He initially worked with [[José Clemente Orozco]], who impressed him both with art as well as politics. Chávez Morado\\'s most prolific period was between 1955 and 1967, when he realized works in the [[University City of Mexico|Ciudad Universitaria]] in Mexico City, the [[Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Mexico)|Secretariat of Communications and Transportation]] building in Mexico City and the [[Alhóndiga de Granaditas]] in his hometown. Olga Costa\\'s real last name was Kostakowsky, but it was [[Hispanicization|Hispanicized]] to Costa. She was born in [[Leipzig]], Germany but she and her family moved to Mexico when she was very young. She was friends with and contemporaries of Diego Rivera, [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Rufino Tamayo]] and [[Carlos Mérida]], as well as wife to José Chávez Morado. She is best known for founding the Galería Espiral and co-founder of the Sociedad de Arte Moderno and the Salon de Plastica Mexicana. Her best known work is titled \"Vendedora de Frutas\".<ref name=\"r1516\">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 15–16</ref>\\nOther artists include [[Manuel Leal]], whose works are mostly scenes from the state, [[Romualdo Garcia]], better known as a photographer than painter, [[Hermenegildo Bustos]], [[Hilario Gómez Sánchez]] and [[Luis Ferro Márquez]]. The state also produced one well-known sculptor by the name of [[Tomás Chávez Morado]], brother of José. His works can be seen at the Museo Regional de la Alhóndiga de Granaditas and the [[Museo del Caracol]] in Mexico City.<ref name=\"r1617\">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 16–17</ref>\\n\\nGuanajuato\\'s three main literary figures are [[Jorge Ibargüengoitia]], [[Juan Ibáñez]] and [[Efraín Huerta]]. Ibargüengoitia was one of Mexico\\'s most important writers of the 20th century, noted for his satirical works with social themes.

It is one of the older sites of Mesoamerica, having been active from 800&nbsp;BCE to 300&nbsp;CE and shows some of the earliest evidence of agriculture. The site has low flat rectangular platforms, with evidence of earlier structures below, which were probably the foundation of multigenerational houses; however most of the site is now under the waters of the Solís Dam.<ref name=\"trabajos\"/> This site, along with some nearby contemporary sites, is known for its pottery called \"Blanco Levantado\", characterized with red and other colored lines on a light or cream background. This pottery has been shown to have elements in common with pottery in Zacatecas, other areas in northwest Mexico and even that of the [[Hohokam]] in [[Arizona]] and researchers believe that these people had trade relations that far north even finding [[turquoise]]. While the site has been extensively studied, it has also suffered looting, including some at the hands of Guanajuato authorities.<ref name=\"arqueomex\"/>\\n\\nTierra Blanca is a large site which was a true city, not a ceremonial site, but most of the site had been sacked and practically destroyed when it fell and later as an archeological site although early photographs of it remain. There is evidence in Tula that this city, or one like it, had had significant influence on the Tula civilization. For this reason, the time span for Tierra Blanca is placed at before 950 CE although there is little evidence at the site itself to date it.<ref name=\"arqueomex\"/>\\n\\n[[Carabino]] is located in the northeast of the state. At this site items from and influenced by the city of Tula are found dating the city to about 900 to 1150&nbsp;CE. There is some evidence to suggest that the city was a colony of one of the cities of the center of Mexico. In Villa de Reyes in the far north in the Valley of San Luis, there also evidence of Toltec presence or influence. However, this later site was occupied first between 550 and 710 CE, then again in the Toltec era 200 to 300 years later. Evidence suggests that groups in these parts of Guanajuato had an effect on the organization of the [[Toltec Empire]] as settlements were abandoned sometime between 600 and 900&nbsp;CE. Through the Toltecs\\' influence in the [[Valley of Mexico]], Guanajuato cultures eventually had some influence on the much later Aztec.<ref name=\"arqueomex\"/>\\n\\n[[File:Plazuelas.JPG|thumb|One of the structures at the [[Plazuelas]] archeological site]]\\n[[Plazuelas]] is located just west of Pénjamo in the foothills of the Sierra de Pénjamo. The site, which is noted for the complexity of its architecture, was occupied during the first millennium of the Common Era with its height at around 600 to 900&nbsp;CE. The site was constructed over three hillsides separated by two large arroyos called Los Cuijes and Agua Nacida. The ethnicity of its occupants is not known nor is its original name. It appears to have been a theocracy with the elite inhabiting the hillsides and the rest of the population on flatter lands below. The most important construction at the site is the complex called Casas Tapadas, which contains several large structures and one [[Mesoamerican ball game|Mesoamerican ball court]].<ref name=\"d2223\"/>\\n\\n[[Peralta (Mesoamerican site)|Peralta]] is located on Abasolo, 21&nbsp;km from Pénjamo. It developed between 300 and 700&nbsp;CE, at the time that Teotihuacan was declining and Tula was rising. According to archeologists, the city declined and collapsed due to the [[overexploitation]] of the surrounding deciduous rainforest and it was abandoned around 900&nbsp;CE. The site occupies 150 hectares divided into a center with five surrounding settlements. The most important structure is called the \"Patio Hundido\" (Sunken Patio), whose name comes from the four pyramids that are at the corners. Another important building is the La Mesita (The Small Table) or Recinto de los Gobernantes (Governors\\' Precinct). It has a large plaza which is considered to have been the main square for the city. Among the walls and other structures a semicircle dedicated to the Danza de Voladores has been discovered.<ref name=\"d2324\">Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 23–24</ref>\\n\\n[[Cañada de la Virgen]] contains a number of closely related architectonic complexes. Complex A, also called the Casa de los Trece Cielos (House of the Thirteen Heavens or Skies), consists of a large \"sunken\" patio like that in Peralta surrounded a pyramidal base over 25&nbsp;meters high and platforms that enclose the west, north and south sides. El Cóporo is situated on a small mountain and probably used by a group related to the Toltecs. It was at its height between 500 and 600&nbsp;CE. but abandoned by 900&nbsp;CE. It is a ceremonial center constructed of adobe and earth. One unique aspect of its construction is a series of columns which sink into the earth to a depth of about two and a half meters.<ref name=\"d25\">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 25</ref>\\nOther archeological sites in the state include Morales in San Miguel and [[El Cóporo]] in the northwest.

It borders: [[Pernambuco]] (N and NW); [[Sergipe]] (S); [[Bahia]] (SW); and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] (E). Its capital is the city of [[Maceió]]. It has 1.6% of the Brazilian population and produces 0.8% of the Brazilian [[GDP]]. It is made up of 102 [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]] and its most populous cities are Maceió, [[Arapiraca]], [[Palmeira dos Índios]], [[Rio Largo]], [[Penedo]], [[União dos Palmares]], [[São Miguel dos Campos]], [[Santana do Ipanema]], [[Delmiro Gouveia]], [[Coruripe]], and [[Campo Alegre, Alagoas|Campo Alegre]].\\n\\nIt is the second smallest Brazilian state in area (larger only than Sergipe) and it is [[List of Brazilian states by population|16th in population]]. It is also one of the largest producers of [[sugarcane]], [[coconut]]s, and [[natural gas]] in the country. Alagoas also has oil exploration, mostly of onshore deposits.\\n\\nLand of the \\'\\'[[Mytella charruana|sururu]]\\'\\' (or Charru Mussel), lagoon shellfish which serves as food for the coastal population, and of coconut water, Alagoas also possesses some of the country\\'s richest [[folklore]].\\n\\nInitially, the territory of Alagoas constituted the southern part of the [[Captaincy of Pernambuco]] and only gained its autonomy in 1817. Its occupation pushed the expansion of the [[Captaincy|captaincy\\'s]] sugarcane farming, which required new areas of cultivation, southward. Thus arose [[Porto Calvo]], Alagoas (now Marechal Deodoro) and [[Penedo]], nuclei which guided the colonization, economic, and social life of the region for a long time.\\n\\nThe [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch invasion]] in Pernambuco was extended to Alagoas in 1631. The invaders were expelled in 1645, after intense fighting in Porto Calvo, leaving the economy in ruins.\\n\\nThe escape of [[Slavery in Brazil|African slaves]] during the Dutch invasion created a serious labour shortage problem on the [[Engenho|sugarcane plantations]]. Grouped in villages called [[quilombo]]s, the Africans were only completely dominated at the end of the 17th century with the destruction of the most important quilombo, [[Palmares (quilombo)|Palmares]].\\n\\nDuring the [[Empire of Brazil|empire]], the separatist and republican [[Confederation of the Equator]] received the support of noteworthy figures from Alagoas.

The coast is bordered by fringing reefs and many fine beaches. Behind the beaches, sometimes only hundreds of meters and defined by steep scarps, lies a stretch of green coastal hills having enough rainfall for considerable agriculture and scarce remnants of the [[Atlantic Forest]] that now is largely limited to steep hill tops or steep valley sides and bottoms. This is the area long dominated by sugar cane.\\n\\nStill farther inland lies the Sertão of the Northeast region of the nation. The Sertão is a high dry region dominated by scrub that is often thorn-filled and sometimes toxic, the [[caatinga]]. This area and its people are famed in legend and song. It is the land of the cowboy who is clad from head to toe (if he is lucky) with very thick leather to avoid the sharp vegetation.\\n\\n==History==\\n{{Main articles|History of Alagoas}}\\n[[Image:Museu de arte sacra do convento de Santa Maria (Marechal Deodoro, AL).jpg|thumb|right|Convent of Santa Maria, [[Marechal Deodoro, Alagoas|Marechal Deodoro]].]]\\nDuring the first three centuries of its history, Alagoas was part of the captaincy of Pernambuco, only becoming an independent captaincy in 1817.  As a reprisal against the [[Pernambucan revolt|Pernambuco Revolution]], the King [[João VI|John VI]] of [[Portugal]] ordered a vast portion of the territory of Pernambuco to be taken from it, most including its southern portion, one part was given to the captaincy of [[Bahia]], the other portion was made independent, creating Alagoas as a new Brazilian captaincy.\\n\\nInitially, in the first years of the 16th century, Alagoas settlement went on slowly, however helped by Africans turned into slaves whose work urged the local economy. In the period of the 16th and 17th centuries, French pirates invaded its territory attracted by the commerce of [[Paubrasilia|brazilwood]].\\n\\nSome time later, [[Duarte Coelho]], owner of the captaincy of Pernambuco, gave the control of the region back to the Portuguese, running the territory as part of his captaincy. He increased the number of sugar cane plantations and built some sugar mills, as well as founding the cities of Penedo and [[Marechal Deodoro, Alagoas|Alagoas]] – this last one originally baptized by Portuguese as Santa Maria Madalena da Alagoa do Sul (Saint Mary Magdalene of the Southern Lake), currently the historic heritage town of Deodoro da Fonseca.\\n\\nIn 1570, a second expedition ordered by Duarte Coelho and led by [[Cristóvão Lins]], explored the north of Alagoas and founded the settlement of Porto Calvo and five sugar mills, which two of them still endure, Buenos Aires and Escurial.\\n\\nIn 1630, the territory was taken by the Dutch, whose interest was to manage the commerce of sugarcane in most parts of the northeastern region of Brazil. As part of one of the wealthiest Brazilian captaincies, Alagoas prospered along with the [[sugar trade]]. They built \\'\\'Fort Maurits\\'\\' in Penedo, on the river São Francisco. However, the Dutch colonizers abandoned the territory after being defeated in 1646.\\n\\nDecades before Alagoas was formed in 1817, its [[sugar industry]] had 200 mills, and agriculture also involved cotton, tobacco and corn plantations. With [[Independence of Brazil|Brazilian independence]] from Portugal in 1822, Alagoas became a [[Province of Alagoas|province]]. In 1839, the capital of the province was changed definitively from [[Marechal Deodoro, Alagoas|the town of Alagoas]] to Maceió, mainly due to the increasing growth of the city because of its port.\\n\\n==Demographics==\\n[[Image:Maceio02.jpg|thumb|[[Pajuçara]] Beach in [[Maceió]].]]\\n{{See also|Largest Cities of Northeast Region, Brazil}}\\nAccording to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] of 2008, there were 3,173,000 people residing in the state.

[[Agriculture]] represents 7.3% of the state\\'s [[GDP]] (2004). Alagoas exports consist of: [[sugar]] 58.8%, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] 29.4%, [[chemicals]] 9%, [[tobacco]] 2.1% (2002).\\n\\nThe economy has been [[agriculture|agricultural]], dependent largely on large sugarcane plantations with some [[tobacco]] farming that is concentrated around the city of Arapiraca. Sugar cane formed the basis for an [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] industry that is in decline. Small to medium-sized tanker ships took alcohol on board in Maceio\\'s port with considerable frequency during the peak period. Such loads still take place with less frequency. Another local industry is based on chemical products from [[brine]] pumped from deep wells on the outskirts of Maceió.\\n[[File:Maragogi.jpg|thumb|500x500px]]\\nIn the last twenty years the [[tourism|tourist]] industry has found the beaches and Maceió itself has changed from a rather sleepy little port with coconut palm plantations along its beaches to high-rise hotels. The northern coast, particularly around the towns Maragogi and Japaratinga is beginning to see some of this development in the form of resorts attracting people from the south and from [[Europe]]. There is considerable European investment (as of 2007) in beach property north of Maceió with walled compounds of beach homes.\\n\\n== Infrastructure ==\\n\\n===International Airport===\\nAlagoas gained a new airport complex, [[Zumbi dos Palmares International Airport]], in the Maceió Metropolitan Area, designed by homegrown architect Mário Aloísio, which combines glass, metal and granite. It includes space for art exhibitions, a panoramic deck, chapel, seven escalators, nine elevators and four boarding bridges. The whole terminal was designed to permit access by the physically disabled, with ramps and special bathroom fixtures.{{cn|date=September 2022}}\\n\\nIn the new terminal, [[Infraero]] also brings to Maceió \"Aeroshopping\" – a concept that is transforming the country\\'s airports into centers for leisure and high-quality products and services. The entire building has a computerized air conditioning, with commercial spaces that will be occupied gradually. The parking area was more than tripled. Demand will be able to grow to 1.2 million passengers a year since the new passenger terminal has 24,000 square meters, the triple of its former size. The check-in counters were doubled and can reach higher numbers without any structural remodeling. The building is \"intelligent\", meaning controlled by a computerized system that regulates factors ranging from the lighting level to air temperature and even the speed of the escalators. This system also controls access to restricted areas and the fire protection system, among others.{{cn|date=September 2022}}\\n\\n[[Image:Lagoa Mundaú.jpg|thumb|right|Mundaú Lake.]]\\n\\n===Highways===\\n*[[BR-101]]\\n*[[BR-104]]\\n*[[BR-110]]\\n*[[BR-316]]\\n*BR-423\\n*BR-424\\n\\n===Port===\\nThe Port of Jaraguá is located in Maceió.

The Port of Jaraguá is situated in a natural port area that facilitates the ships docking. During the colonial period, the most important products exported through the port were sugar, tobacco, coconut and spices.{{cn|date=September 2022}}\\n\\n==Culture==\\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2022}}\\n===Festa Junina (Saint John Festival)===\\n[[Festa Junina]] was introduced to Northeastern Brazil by the Portuguese for whom St. John\\'s day (also celebrated as [[Midsummer]] Day in several European countries), on 24 June, is one of the oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. Differently, of course, from what happens on the European Midsummer Day, the festivities in Brazil do not take place during the [[summer solstice]] but during the tropical [[winter solstice]]. The festivities traditionally begin after the 12th of June, on the eve of St. Anthony\\'s day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter\\'s day. During these fifteen days, there are [[bonfires]], [[fireworks]], and folk dancing in the streets (step names are in French, which shows the mutual influences between court life and peasant culture in the 17th, 18th, and 19th-century Europe). Once exclusively a rural festivity, today it is largely a city festival during which people joyfully and theatrically mimic peasant stereotypes and cliches in a spirit of joke and good time. Typical dishes and drinks are served. Like during [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]], these festivities involve costumes-wearing (in this case, peasant costumes), dancing and visual spectacles (fireworks display and folk dancing). Like what happens on Midsummer and St. John\\'s Day in Europe, bonfires are a central part of these festivities in Brazil.\\n\\n===Carnival===\\nThe four-day period before Lent leading up to Ash Wednesday is carnival time in Brazil. People of diverse origins or social classes forget their cares as they party in the streets.\\n\\n===Warrior===\\nThis is a typical Alagoas revelry that resulted from the union of Reisado (an Epiphany celebration), Auto dos Caboclinhos (Caboclinhos’ Play), Chegança (public folk play depicting a naval battle) and Pastoril (outdoor folk play). Its captivating choreography and costumes with colored ribbons and beads reproduce the cathedral’s façades on the monumental hats covered with mirrors.\\n[[Image:Pajuçara.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pajuçara]] Beach in [[Maceió]].]]\\n\\n===Fandango===\\nThis is a dramatic dance motivated by the sea. It tells the sea adventures of the first navigators in its songs accompanied by guitar and ukulele.\\n\\n===Carnival Bull===\\nBoi do Carnaval is a popular culture display derived from Bumba-Meu-Boi. It is always presented together with La Ursa (The Bear), Vaqueiro (Cowboy) and a percussion band whose rhythms captivate all who hear them.\\n\\n==Sports==\\n[[File:Rei Pelé.jpg|thumb|[[Estádio Rei Pelé]] in [[Maceió]].]]\\nAlagoas provides visitors and residents with various sport activities.

Intermasa.</ref>\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\n{{also|Gorontalo people#Etymology}}\\nThe word \\'\\'Gorontalo\\'\\' comes from the word \\'\\'Hulontalo\\'\\' in the Gorontalo language. \\'\\'Hulontalo\\'\\' is derived from the word \\'\\'Hulontalangi\\'\\', a name of one of the Kingdoms in Gorontalo. In addition, there are several historical records regarding the origin of the name Gorontalo, including:<ref>Badudu, Y., 1982. Morfologi Bahasa Gorontalo. Djambatan.</ref>\\n\\n#Gorontalo comes from the word \"Hulontalangi\", which means \"Valley of the Noble\". Hulontalangi comes from two syllables, namely \"Huluntu\" which means \"Valley\" and \"Langi\" which means \"Noble\".\\n#Gorontalo comes from the word \"Hulontalangi\", which means \"Inundated Land\". The word \"Hulontalangi\" in other translations comes from two syllables, namely \"Huntu\" which means \"Piles of Soils\" or \"Mainland\", and \"Langi-Langi\" which means \"Flooded\". Then the word \"Hulontalangi\" can also be interpreted as \"Flooded Land\" according to the story of the people of Gorontalo.\\n#Gorontalo comes from the word \"Huidu Totolu\", which means \"Three Mountains\". If traced its history, there are three ancient mountains on the Gorontalo peninsula, namely Mount Malenggalila, Mount Tilonggabila (changed to Tilongkabila) and another Mountain which is not named.\\n#Gorontalo comes from the word \"Pogulatalo\", which means \"Place of Waiting\". The word \"Pogulatalo\" gradually changed in the words of the community to \"Hulatalo\"\\n#Gorontalo comes from the word \"Hulontalo\". However, due to difficulties in pronunciation, the Dutch colonizers referred to \"Hulontalo\" as \"Gorontalo\".\\n\\nGorontalo people sometime refer themselves as \\'\\'Hulandalo\\'\\' or \\'\\'Hulantalo\\'\\', a well-known term in Gorontalo and North Sulawesi, which usually refers to the region of Gorontalo or the native people from Gorontalo.\\n\\n== History ==\\nHistorically, Gorontalo has been the centre for the spread of [[Islam]] in Eastern Indonesia, dating back to the pre-colonial era. The province also was the seat of many independent Gorontaloan kingdoms. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] arrived in the beginning of the 17th century, subjugating the local kingdoms and finally annexed the area into the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Gorontalo was briefly occupied by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during [[World War II]], before finally becoming part of the independent Republic of Indonesia. \\n\\nGorontalo was incorporated into the province of North Sulawesi, but after the [[Fall of Suharto]], the government decided to create a new province, owing to the cultural and religious differences to the Christian-majority province of North Sulawesi and also as part of the country\\'s decentralization program. Hence, the new province was created on 5 December 2000.\\n\\nCompared to other provinces of Indonesia, Gorontalo is one of the least developed provinces. As of 2017, Gorontalo scores 0.670 in [[Human Development Index]], one of the lowest in Indonesia. It ranks 28th out of the 34 provinces. Compared to the neighbouring provinces such as North Sulawesi, Gorontalo\\'s infrastructure is very poorly developed. The province has often suffered from electricity crises as well as water shortages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20150223165155-85-34205/provinsi-gorontalo-krisis-listrik|title=Provinsi Gorontalo Krisis Listrik|last=Duta|first=Diemas Kresna|work=ekonomi|access-date=16 November 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.beritasatu.com/nasional/269040-68-desa-di-gorontalo-krisis-air-bersih-dan-sanitasi.html|title=68 Desa di Gorontalo Krisis Air Bersih dan Sanitasi|work=beritasatu.com|access-date=16 November 2018|language=id}}</ref> Nevertheless, the government is currently attempting to improve Gorontalo\\'s infrastructure, with construction projects such as the Gorontalo Outer Ring Road, Randangan Dam and the Anggrek Power Plant.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wartaekonomi.co.id/read188004/jokowi-akan-resmikan-sejumlah-infrastruktur-di-gorontalo.html|title=Jokowi Akan Resmikan Sejumlah Infrastruktur di Gorontalo|date=20 July 2018|work=Warta Ekonomi|access-date=16 November 2018}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Pre-Colonial era ===\\nThe peninsula which includes Gorontalo has had some type of human civilization since approximately 1300 years ago.{{clarify|date=April 2019}} Historical records show a Kingdom of [[Suwawa]] as existing in 8th century CE.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Suwawa|first1=Kerajaan|title=suwawa kingdom|url=http://www.gimonca.com/sejarah/sejarah01.shtml|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> This is reinforced by the discovery of the tomb of their king, Moluadu, on the banks of the river Bulawa along with his wife and child.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bahasa Bonda dan Kubur Keramat|date=7 June 2012|url=https://gorontaloholiday.wordpress.com/2012/06/08/bahasa-bonda-bahasa-tertua-di-gorontalo-yang-terancam-punah/|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref>\\n\\nHowever, Gorontalo Peninsula did not just have historical records on the inscription King ancient tombs, but it also has prehistoric sites.

It is estimated, Gorontalo has been around since approximately 400 years ago or around the 1500s in the 16th century. Previously Gorontalo City became one of the centers of Islamic religion in Eastern Indonesia, in addition to Ternate (now part of North Maluku Province).<ref>{{cite news|title=Kota Tua Gorontalo|url=http://www.kompasiana.com/300387helman/kota-gorontalo-entrepreneur-wisata-dan-historis_5500af82a333111e73511b3e|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref>\\n\\nAlong with the spread of the religion, Gorontalo city eventually became the centre of education and commerce for the surrounding regions such as [[Bolaang Mongondow Regency|Bolaang Mongondow]] ([[North Sulawesi]]), [[Buol Regency|Buol]], [[Luwuk]], [[Banggai fruit dove|Banggai]], [[Donggala Regency|Donggala]] ([[Central Sulawesi]]) and even further towards [[Southeast Sulawesi]]. This is because of its strategic location, its position facing directly into the [[Gulf of Tomini]] (south) and the [[Celebes Sea|Sulawesi Sea]] (north).\\n\\nBefore the colonial period Gorontalo was governed under customary law. Kingdoms were united in a bond of kinship called \"Pohala\\'a\". According to Haga (1931) there are five pohala\\'a Gorontalo area:<ref>{{cite web|title=Sejarah Gorontalo|url=http://www.pn-gorontalo.go.id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=34|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref>\\n*Pohala\\'a Gorontalo\\n*Pohala\\'a Limboto\\n*Pohala\\'a Suwawa\\n*Pohala\\'a Bolango then be Pohala\\'a Boalemo\\n*Pohala\\'a Atinggola\\n\\nBased on the classification made by the Mr. C. Vollenhoven, the Gorontalo peninsula was included among the 19 indigenous areas in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daerah Adat Indonesia|url=http://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpcbgorontalo/2014/05/09/sejarah-gorontalo_indonesia/|access-date=8 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075922/http://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpcbgorontalo/2014/05/09/sejarah-gorontalo_indonesia/|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Between religion and customs in Gorontalo was fused with the term \"Adat bersendikan Syara \\'and Syara\\' bersendikan Kitabullah\". Pohalaa Gorontalo is the most prominent among the five Pohalaa. That is why Gorontalo is more widely known.\\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Schepen in de Baai van Gorontalo TMnr 60039475.jpg|thumb|Dutch ships in Gorontalo.

The Dutch ruled Gorontalo for almost three centuries.]]\\n\\n=== Colonial era ===\\nWesterners began arriving in the Indonesian archipelago starting in the 16th century because of interest in spices from Indonesia, especially spices from the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku islands]]. The first Westerners to come to Indonesia were the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], who sailed from [[Malacca City|Malacca]] to [[Gresik Regency|Gresik]] in [[East Java]] and then to the Moluccas, where spices were collected. Then followed the [[Spaniards]], who arrived in 1521 with two ships through the [[Philippines]], [[Borneo]], [[Tidore]], [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]], and [[Jailolo (town)|Jailolo]], until they sailed to Maluku until 1534.\\n\\nThen the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] came to Indonesia and arrived in Banten in 1596, which was also a place for trading spices from the surrounding area. In 1607, the Dutch visited the [[Minahasa Peninsula]], with the approval of the Sultan of Ternate. As the peninsula at that time was part of the [[Sultanate of Ternate]], the Dutch were assigned by the Sultan to order all Ternate people who were in [[Manado]] to return to Ternate. This was done to make it easier for the Dutch to repulse Spain in Manado who came to North Sulawesi through the Philippines. In 1617, the [[Spaniards]] tried to spread [[Catholicism]] to the local people around [[Lake Tondano]] by force, but they were repulsed by the local community. The local chief requested the Dutch for help, and the Spaniards was repulsed from the area.\\n\\nSince then, in North Sulawesi, the Dutch began to establish its hegemony, then after the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) governor in Ternate, Robertus Padtbrugge, traveled across North Sulawesi to Kwandang to make a contractual decision in 1678. The Gorontaloan and Limbotoan localities could do nothing when the Ternate Sultanate handed over Gorontalo and Limboto regions to the VOC.\\n\\nGorontalo was important to the VOC because it contained food ingredients such as rice, chocolate and coconut, besides that in the mountains there are also gold mines, such as in the areas of Samalata, Marisa, Bonepantai, and Bintauna. Seeing these conditions, the VOC established a trading post, through which the trade offices between the Dutch government and Gorontaloan kingdoms were officially started.\\n\\nSubsequent developments, the political transition of the VOC to the [[Dutch East Indies]] at the turn of the 18th century to the 19th century was marked by VOC bankruptcy caused by various factors, such as accounting fraud, corruption, weak employee capabilities, monopoly systems, and systems forced which brought about the moral deterioration of the rulers and the suffering of the population.\\n\\nEntering the 19th century as the transition of the government process of centralization of government administration from the central level to the village level was inevitable for the Dutch colonies, especially Gorontalo.\\n\\n[[File:Monumen Nani Wartabone.JPG|thumb|upright|A monument of [[Nani Wartabone]], a Gorontaloan national hero who resisted both the Dutch and the Japanese.]]\\n\\n=== Japanese Occupation and Independence ===\\nThe [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] occupied Gorontalo during [[World War II]], ending three centuries of Dutch colonial rule. Gorontalo was subjected to air bombing as well as naval shelling by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] over the course of the war, resulting in severe civilian casualties.\\n\\nPrior to the onset of [[Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]], [[Nani Wartabone]] headed a Gorontalan Independence Movement, declaring itself sovereign on 23 January 1942.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gorontaloprov.go.id/profil/sejarah|title=Sejarah Gorontalo|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> For approximately two years Gorontalo was effectively a self-governing region. This was a milestone in the struggle for independence and inspired similar efforts both on [[Celebes]] and across the Indonesian archipelago. However, this was brutally opposed by the Japanese, and the [[Kenpeitai]] arrested and tortured many pro-Independence advocate, including Wartabone himself. Wartabone was eventually recognized by the [[Indonesian government]] as a [[National Hero of Indonesia]]. Today, he is buried in his hometown of Suwawa, in the eastern part of the province.\\n\\nAfter the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the Japanese handed the area to the local pro-Independence militia. However, the Dutch returned to Gorontalo to assume control, resulting in an inevitable [[Indonesian National Revolution|war]] between the Dutch forces and the Indonesian Republicans. After the [[Linggadjati Agreement]] between the Dutch and the Indonesian, Gorontalo was incorporated into the [[State of East Indonesia]], a state of the [[United States of Indonesia]]. In 1950, Gorontalo became part of the province of [[North Sulawesi]] in a now unitary Republic of Indonesia.\\n\\nIn 1957, chaos and lack of attention by the central government in [[Jakarta]] resulted in a rebellion by [[Permesta]] which was based in Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi. However, Gorontalo was not much affected by the rebellion, as the locals still supported the central government. The rebellion was crushed in 1960 after the government assaulted and captured Manado.\\n\\nIn 2000, Gorontalo City and two regencies, with their Muslim-majority communities, were spun off from North Sulawesi into a separate province with Gorontalo as the provincial seat.\\n\\n==Geography==\\n[[File:Gorontalo-Kwandangarea-Indonesia-cloudyday.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kwandang]] area.]]\\nGorontalo lies on the northern peninsula of [[Sulawesi]], also known as the [[Minahasa Peninsula]].

Its capital is [[Bhisho]], but its two largest cities are [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] and Port Elizabeth.\\n\\nThe second largest province in the country (at 168,966&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) after [[Northern Cape]], it was formed in 1994 out of the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] homelands or [[bantustan]]s of [[Transkei]] and [[Ciskei]], together with the eastern portion of the [[Cape Province]]. The central and eastern part of the province is the traditional home of the indigenous [[Xhosa people]]. In 1820 this area which was known as the [[Xhosa Kingdom]] began to be settled by Europeans who originally came from England and some from [[Scotland]] and Ireland.\\n\\nSince South Africa\\'s early years, many Xhosas believed in Africanism and figures such as [[Walter Rubusana]] believed that the rights of Xhosa people and Africans in general, could not be protected unless Africans mobilized and worked together. As a result, the Eastern Cape is home to many anti-apartheid leaders such as [[Robert Sobukwe]], [[Oliver Tambo]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Walter Sisulu]], [[Winnie Mandela]], [[Govan Mbeki]], [[Alfred Xuma]], [[Cecilia Makiwane]], [[Noni Jabavu]] among others. It is also home the then young [[Thabo Mbeki]], [[Chris Hani]], [[Bantu Holomisa]], [[Steve Biko]], musicians [[Miriam Makeba]], [[Madosini]], [[Nathi]], [[Vusi Nova]] and [[Zahara (South African musician)|Zahara]] as well as historical figures such as [[Tiyo Soga|Rev. Tiyo Soga]], [[Samuel Mqhayi]], [[Mongezi Sifika wa Nkomo]], [[Enoch Sontonga]] and [[Jotello Festiri Soga]].\\n\\n==History==\\nThe Eastern Cape as a South African Province came into existence in 1994 and incorporated areas from the former Xhosa homelands of the [[Transkei]] and [[Ciskei]], together with what was previously part of the [[Cape Province]]. This resulted in several anomalies including the fact that the Province has four supreme courts (in [[Makhanda, Eastern Cape|Grahamstown]] (Makhanda), [[Port Elizabeth]] (Gqeberha), Bhisho and [[Mthatha]]) and had enclaves of [[KwaZulu-Natal]] in the province. The latter anomaly has fallen away with amendments to municipal and provincial boundaries.\\n\\nThe Xhosa Kingdom was one of the most powerful kingdoms in Africa and had all states in the Eastern Cape as tributaries. Any group, people or tribe that recognized the Xhosa Kingdom as Paramouncy became Xhosa, practiced Xhosa culture and used isiXhosa as their main language. Some of the tribes that fall under the category of Xhosa people include: AmaMpondo, AbaThembu, AmaMpondomise, AmaHlubi, AmaBhaca, AmaXesibe, AmaBomvana and more.{{Original research inline|date=May 2019}}\\n\\n===European settlers===\\n{{main | Graaff-Reinet | 1820 Settlers}}\\nIn the late 18th century the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] slowly expanded eastwards from its original centre around Cape Town. This led to the establishment in 1786 of the Dutch settlement of [[Graaff-Reinet]] – named for the [[Governor of the Dutch Cape Colony|Governor of the Cape Colony]] [[Cornelis Jacob van de Graaff|Cornelius Jacob van de Graaff]] (in office: 1785–1791) and for his wife Hester Cornelia van de Graaff (née Reynet). Later, during the [[Napoleonic wars]] of 1803–1815, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] took control of the [[Colony of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Colony]] (1806) and encouraged British citizens to migrate there as a means to boost the British population{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} in the area.\\n\\nFrom the early 1800s until the formation of the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910, the Eastern Cape saw colonisation by British [[human migration|migrant]]s. English [[settler]]s established most of the towns, naming them either for places in England or for the original founders. [[British colonisation]] saw schools, churches, hospitals, town centres and government buildings built to speed up development.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Some of the older European settlements include: [[Makhanda, Eastern Cape|Grahamstown]] (1812), [[Port Elizabeth]](1820), [[Salem, Eastern Cape|Salem]](1820), [[Bathurst, Eastern Cape|Bathurst]](1820), [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]](1836),[[Paterson, Eastern Cape|Paterson]] (1879), [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]](1814), Fort Beaufort (1816) and [[King William\\'s Town, Eastern Cape|King William\\'s Town]](1836).\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\nThe population of Eastern Cape Province is 6,562,053, of whom 86.3% are [[Bantu peoples of South Africa|Black]], 8.3% are [[Coloureds]], 4.7% are [[White South Africans|White]] and 0.4% are [[Indian South Africans|Indian/Asian]]. A large majority of people in the province are [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], with 78.8% of residents in Eastern Cape identifying as Xhosa as of 2011. Unlike most of [[South Africa]] the [[White South Africans|White]] population has a large percent of [[British diaspora in Africa|British descent]].  Roughly 50% of [[White South Africans]] in Eastern Cape are English-speakers of [[British diaspora in Africa|British descent]] while the other 50% of [[White South Africans|Whites]] in the province are of [[Boer]]/[[Afrikaner]] ancestry. Eastern Cape is one of only two provinces in [[South Africa]] where [[British diaspora in Africa|British descended Whites]] outnumber [[Boers]]/[[Afrikaners]], the other being [[Kwazulu-Natal]]. [[Port Elizabeth]] is the largest city in Eastern Cape Province.<ref>{{cite book |title=Census 2011: Census in brief |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf |publisher=Statistics South Africa |location=Pretoria |year=2012 |isbn=9780621413885 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513171240/http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf |archive-date=13 May 2015 |url-status=live}}{{rp|9}}</ref>\\n\\n== Notable people ==\\n{{Main|List of people from the Eastern Cape}}\\n\\n==Law and government==\\n{{main|Politics of the Eastern Cape}}\\nThe first premier was [[Raymond Mhlaba]] and the current premier is [[Oscar Mabuyane]], both of the [[African National Congress]]. The province is served by the capital of Bhisho next to King William\\'s Town. The parliament and other important government buildings are situated in the precinct. The High Court that is superior to all courts in the region is situated in Grahamstown and has local seats in Port Elizabeth, East London, and Bhisho.\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n[[image:ISS059-E-91096 - View of South Africa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The southern part of the province seen from [[International Space Station|space]]. Various mountain ranges in the [[Cape Fold Belt]] are visible, besides [[Cape Recife]] and [[Cape St. Francis]].]]\\n{{See also|List of cities and towns in the Eastern Cape}}\\nThe Eastern Cape gets progressively wetter from west to east. The west is mostly semiarid [[Karoo]], except in the far south, which is temperate rainforest in the Tsitsikamma region. The coast is generally rugged with interspersed beaches. Most of the province is hilly to very mountainous between [[Graaff-Reinet]] and Rhodes including the [[Sneeuberge]] (English: Snow Mountains), [[Stormberg Mountains|Stormberge]], [[Winterberg, Eastern Cape|Winterberge]] and [[Drakensberg]] (English: Dragon Mountains). The highest point in the province is [[Ben Macdhui (South Africa)|Ben Macdhui]] at 3001 m. The east from [[East London, South Africa|East London]] and [[Komani, Eastern Cape|Queenstown]] towards the [[KwaZulu-Natal]] border – a region known previously as [[Transkei]] – is lush grassland on rolling hills, punctuated by deep gorges with intermittent forest.\\n\\nEastern Cape has a [[coast]] on its east which lines southward, creating shores leading to the south Indian Ocean. In the northeast, it borders the following [[districts of Lesotho]]:\\n*[[Mohale\\'s Hoek District]] – west of Quthing\\n*[[Quthing District]] – between Mohale and Qacha\\'s Nek\\n*[[Qacha\\'s Nek District]] – east of Quthing\\n\\nDomestically, it borders the following provinces:\\n*[[Western Cape]] – west\\n*[[Northern Cape]] – northwest\\n*[[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] – north\\n*[[KwaZulu-Natal]] – far northeast\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\nClimate is highly varied. The west is dry with sparse rain during winter or summer, with frosty winters and hot summers. The area [[Tsitsikamma]] to [[Makhanda, Eastern Cape|Grahamstown]] receives more precipitation, which is also relatively evenly distributed and temperatures are mild. Further east, rainfall becomes more plentiful and humidity increases, becoming more subtropical along the coast with summer rainfall. The interior can become very cold in winter, with heavy snowfalls occasionally occurring in the mountainous regions between [[Molteno, Eastern Cape|Molteno]] and [[Rhodes, Eastern Cape|Rhodes]].\\n*[[Port Elizabeth|Gqeberha]]: Jan Max: 25&nbsp;°C, Min: 18&nbsp;°C; Jul Max: 20&nbsp;°C, Min: 9&nbsp;°C\\n*[[Molteno, Eastern Cape|Molteno]] & [[Barkly East]]: Jan Max 28&nbsp;°C, Min 11&nbsp;°C; Jul Max: 14&nbsp;°C, Min: -7&nbsp;°C\\n\\n== Tourism ==\\n[[File:Aloe Ferox between Cofimvaba and Ngcobo.jpg|thumb|upright|\\'\\'[[Aloe ferox]]\\'\\' on the R61 route between Cofimvaba and Ngcobo.]]\\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2022}}The landscape is extremely diverse. The western interior is largely arid [[Karoo]], while the east is well-watered and green. The Eastern Cape offers a wide array of attractions, including {{convert|800|km}} of untouched and pristine coastline along with beaches, and [[Big Five Game|big-five]] game viewing in a [[malaria]]-free environment.\\n\\nThe [[Addo Elephant National Park]], situated {{convert|73|km}} from [[Port Elizabeth]], was proclaimed in 1931. Its {{convert|743|km2}} offers sanctuary to 170 elephants, 400 [[Cape buffalo]] and 21 [[black rhino]] of the very scarce Kenyan sub-species.\\n\\nThe province is the location of [[Tiffindell]], South Africa\\'s only [[snow skiing]] resort, which is situated near the hamlet of [[Rhodes, Eastern Cape|Rhodes]] in the Southern [[Drakensberg]]. It is on the slopes of [[Ben Macdhui (South Africa)|Ben Macdhui]], the highest mountain peak in the Eastern Cape {{convert|3001|m}}.\\n\\nThe [[National Arts Festival]], held annually in [[Makhanda, Eastern Cape|Grahamstown]], is Africa\\'s largest cultural event,{{citation needed|date=July 2022}} offering a choice of both indigenous and imported talent. Every year for eleven days the town\\'s population almost doubles, as over 50,000 people flock to the region for a feast of arts, crafts, music and entertainment.\\n\\n[[Jeffreys Bay]] is an area with wild coastline, which is backed by sub-tropical rainforest. The waters here are noted for having good waves for surfing.\\n\\n[[Aliwal North]], lying on an agricultural plateau on the southern bank of the [[Orange River]], is an inland resort known for its [[hot spring]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\\n\\nThe rugged and unspoiled [[Wild Coast Region, Eastern Cape|Wild Coast]] is a place of spectacular scenery. The coastal areas have been a graveyard for many vessels.\\n\\n[[Whittlesea, Eastern Cape]], situated in the [[Amatola Mountains]], is known for the first wine estate in the province.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\\n\\nKing William\\'s Town, Alice, Queenstown, Grahamstown, Cradock and Fort Beaufort offer some of the best colonial architecture of the 19th century in the province.

The fertile [[Langkloof]] Valley in the southwest has large deciduous [[fruit orchard]]s. In the Karoo there is widespread sheep farming.\\n\\nThe Alexandria-Makhanda area produces pineapples, chicory and dairy products, while coffee and tea are cultivated at Magwa. People in the former Transkei region are dependent on cattle, maize and sorghum-farming. An olive nursery has been developed in collaboration with the [[University of Fort Hare]] to form a nucleus of olive production in the Eastern Cape.\\n\\nDomestic stock farming is slowly giving way to game farming on large scale. [[Eco-tourism]] is resulting in economic benefits, and there is lower risk needed to protect wild, native game against drought, and the natural elements. Habitat loss and poaching pose the greatest problems.\\n\\nThe area around [[Stutterheim]] is being cultivated extensively with timber plantations.\\n\\nThe basis of the province\\'s [[fishing industry]] is [[squid]], some recreational and commercial fishing for line fish, the collection of marine resources, and access to line-catches of [[hake]].\\n\\n===Industry===\\nWith three import/export harbours and three airports offering direct flights to the main centres, and an excellent road and rail infrastructure,{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} the province has been earmarked as a key area for growth and economic development in modern South Africa.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\\n\\nThe two major industrial centres, [[Port Elizabeth]] and [[East London, South Africa|East London]] have well-developed economies based on the automotive industry.

This resulted in several anomalies including the fact that the Province has four supreme courts (in [[Makhanda, Eastern Cape|Grahamstown]] (Makhanda), [[Port Elizabeth]] (Gqeberha), Bhisho and [[Mthatha]]) and had enclaves of [[KwaZulu-Natal]] in the province. The latter anomaly has fallen away with amendments to municipal and provincial boundaries.\n",

      "The Xhosa Kingdom was one of the most powerful kingdoms in Africa and had all states in the Eastern Cape as tributaries. Any group, people or tribe that recognized the Xhosa Kingdom as Paramouncy became Xhosa, practiced Xhosa culture and used isiXhosa as their main language. Some of the tribes that fall under the category of Xhosa people include: AmaMpondo, AbaThembu, AmaMpondomise, AmaHlubi, AmaBhaca, AmaXesibe, AmaBomvana and more.{{Original research inline|date=May 2019}}\n",

Later, during the [[Napoleonic wars]] of 1803–1815, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] took control of the [[Colony of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Colony]] (1806) and encouraged British citizens to migrate there as a means to boost the British population{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} in the area.\n",

      "From the early 1800s until the formation of the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910, the Eastern Cape saw colonisation by British [[human migration|migrant]]s. English [[settler]]s established most of the towns, naming them either for places in England or for the original founders. [[British colonisation]] saw schools, churches, hospitals, town centres and government buildings built to speed up development.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Some of the older European settlements include: [[Makhanda, Eastern Cape|Grahamstown]] (1812), [[Port Elizabeth]](1820), [[Salem, Eastern Cape|Salem]](1820), [[Bathurst, Eastern Cape|Bathurst]](1820), [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]](1836),[[Paterson, Eastern Cape|Paterson]] (1879), [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]](1814), Fort Beaufort (1816) and [[King William's Town, Eastern Cape|King William's Town]](1836).\n",

The Ruta de la Independencia or Independence Route comprises ten municipalities through which the insurgent army under Miguel Hidalgo passed. These include San Miguel de Allende, Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, León, Irapuato, Pénjamo, Salamanca, Celaya, [[Salvatierra, Guanajuato|Salvatierra]] and Acámbaro. In preparation for the Bicentennial of Mexico\\'s independence, the state rehabilitated and marked the sites in which the significant historic events occurred in each of these locations.<ref name=\"d7\">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 7</ref>\\n\\nThe Ruta de Aventura connects ghost towns and abandoned mines with natural areas for hiking, mountain biking and ATV as well as other extreme sports such as [[paragliding]]. One of the ghost towns is Mineral de Pozos in the northeast of the state. The town still has its cobblestone streets with names such as Relámpago (lightning), Estrellas (stars) and Flores (Flowers). The houses here are abandoned, many in ruins and none with roofs. The town reached its height during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was called Ciudad Porfirio Díaz, but the mines later gave out and the population left. In 1982, the town was declared a Historic Monument Zone. Although no one lives there, tourism keeps a few businesses alive around the main square such as the Pozos cantina, which exhibits photographs and other memorabilia on its walls. Outside the town is the Santa Brigida mine which sustained the town until it gave out. It is marked by three large ovens with tall pyramid roofs. These were constructed by the Jesuits to work ore from the mine.<ref name=\"d1213\">Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 12–13</ref> The Ruta Arqueológica (Archeological Route) links the two pre-Hispanic sites of Plazuelas and Peralta which are currently open to visitors with two others which are scheduled to be opened sometime in the future: La Virgen de la Cañada in San Miguel de Allende and El Cóporo in Ocampo.<ref name=\"d2223\">Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 22–23</ref>\\n\\nThe Ruta de los Conventos or Monastery Route is concentrated in the south of the state, where a number of large religious complexes were built in the early colonial period for evangelization purposes. The Agustino de San Pablo Church and Monastery is located in Yuriria founded by the [[Augustinians]] who arrived from Michoacán in the 16th century. It is a monumental fortress-like construction designed by Friar Diego de Chávez y Alvarado and Pedro del Toro and constructed in an area with relatively little population. The monastery became a center from which missionaries would be trained and then sent forth and its size and battlements helped to protect it from [[Chichimeca]] attacks. The church retains its original function and [[Plateresque]] facade, but the monastery area has been converted into a museum. The Las Capucinas Church and Convent is in Salvatierra and is one of only three complexes built for nuns in the entire state during the colonial period. It has a fortress like appearance and its construction is attributed to Joaquin de Heredia, of the [[San Carlos Academy]]. During the [[Porfirio Díaz]] presidency, the convent was used as a Civil Hospital and later as a school, which still remains with the name of Colegio José María Morelos. The San Francisco Church and Monastery is in Acámbaro and built between 1734 and 1743. Its facade is [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] of light pink stone. Inside, the church contains one of the most notable main altars in the Bajio region. It is Neoclassical built of gray and pink stone with gilded details, with an image of the Virgen María Refugio de Pecadores (Virgin Mary Refuge of Sinners), which is replica of an image in [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]].<ref name=\"d30\">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 30</ref>\\n\\nThe Ruta Artesanal (Handcrafts Route) connects a number of municipalities which specialize in one or more handcrafted items, including food. These include Acámbaro, noted for its bread, Coroneo for its wool items and Tarancuaro for ceramics.<ref name=\"d38\"/>\\n\\nThe state also has a large number of water parks and thermal springs converted into water parks.

Wrought iron work for doors, windows and railings are also a specialty in certain areas of the city. Oxidized bronze items are a specialty of Salamanca, producing mostly decorative items.Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 43 Most of the items made in Guanajuato city are still done Baroque style and sold in the city center.Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 43–45 Pénjamo is one of very few places outside of the state of Jalisco to produce tequila. It is the home of the Tequila Corralejo brand, which is still made on the now former hacienda of Corralejo. The installation gives tours and has a museum called the Museo del Vino y la Botellas (Museum of Spirits and Bottles). The museum contains a collection of about 3,000 bottles, almost all of which with their original contents. Nearby is the factory that makes the distinctive blue bottles of this brand.Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 44\n",

      "Glass making was brought to Mexico during the early colonial period. Most items made in Guanajuato are single-colored items in blue, green, yellow and red. San Miguel de Allende has the best-known tradition where curiously shaped bottles, vases, glass sets and small cups for tequila are produced. Wax candles and other items are a specialty in Salamanca, where they are especially in demand during Holy Week. Comonfort is known for the making of molcajetes from volcanic stone, and San Miguel is known for figures and other items made from brass. Dolores Hidalgo is known for ice cream and ices, much of which is simply sold next to the parish church. Flavors include sapote, mango, honey, aloe, tequila and banana.Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 41\n",

      "Mining, manufacturing and construction accounts for over 27% of the state's GDP. Mining is a traditional economic activity for the state, with deposits making it one of the world's richest areas in the past. However, in comparison gold and silver ores are mostly depleted today. Gold and silver ore is still mined with silver still the major ore produced, followed by gold, lead, copper, zinc and sulfur. Most employed in mining are still related to metals rather than non-metals. Other products being mined or being studied are mercury, tin, copper, lead, sand, fluorite, feldspar, lime, kaolin, and more.\n",

      "While the agricultural sector, which includes crops, livestock, fishing and forestry activities, accounts for only 4.6% of Guanajuato's current GDP, the sector is an important part of the state's identity and is still a major producer of a number of items nationally. The state has 1.1 million hectares suitable for agriculture, over 36% of the state's territory. Over  of land is under cultivation, with the main crops being corn, sorghum, beans, wheat, barley and broccoli. Today, the Bajio is still one of the major grain producing regions in Mexico. Certain areas of the state have large orchards producing peaches, strawberries, cactus pear, avocado, grapes, apples, quince, walnuts, apricots and guava.\n",
      "\n",
      "Livestock raising is an important economic activity and can be found in all parts of the state, with animals such cattle, pigs, goats, sheep and domestic fowl, with  hectares dedicated to this activity. The Los Altos and Bajío are the state's livestock producing regions, especially dairy cows. It is one of the most important dairy producing states in Mexico.Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 9 By volume, most of the meat produced is from domestic fowl, with pork coming in second, followed by beef, goat and sheep. Guanajuato produces 25.4% of the goat meat in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a very small percentage of the economy is based on fishing and forestry. Fishing is not a major economic activity as it is limited to the small rivers and lakes of the region. Of the two major lakes, one is shared with neighboring Michoacán state. Of the fish is that is caught or raised, most is carp, followed by mojarra. There are 150,000 hectares of forest in the state, which about half theoretically exploitable. However, forests in this state have been historically depleted with species such as holm oak, pine and oyamel in danger of extinction. The lack of forest cover has led to erosion and other environmental problems. Most forestry products come from pine and holm oak, with most being harvested in the area around the city of Guanajuato.\n",

The three main cities for tourism are the capital city of Guanajuato, San Miguel de Allende and Dolores Hidalgo. Guanajuato is visited for its colonial architecture and its role in Mexico's history, especially during the War of Independence. Similarly, San Miguel has cultural and historical value. Both have been designated World Heritage Sites. Although not a World Heritage Site, Dolores Hidalgo is particularly important as the site as it is where Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla gave the cry called \"El Grito\" which began the War of Independence.\n",

The Ruta de la Independencia or Independence Route comprises ten municipalities through which the insurgent army under Miguel Hidalgo passed. These include San Miguel de Allende, Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, León, Irapuato, Pénjamo, Salamanca, Celaya, Salvatierra and Acámbaro. In preparation for the Bicentennial of Mexico's independence, the state rehabilitated and marked the sites in which the significant historic events occurred in each of these locations.Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 7\n",

      "The Ruta de Aventura connects ghost towns and abandoned mines with natural areas for hiking, mountain biking and ATV as well as other extreme sports such as paragliding. One of the ghost towns is Mineral de Pozos in the northeast of the state. The town still has its cobblestone streets with names such as Relámpago (lightning), Estrellas (stars) and Flores (Flowers). The houses here are abandoned, many in ruins and none with roofs. The town reached its height during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was called Ciudad Porfirio Díaz, but the mines later gave out and the population left. In 1982, the town was declared a Historic Monument Zone. Although no one lives there, tourism keeps a few businesses alive around the main square such as the Pozos cantina, which exhibits photographs and other memorabilia on its walls. Outside the town is the Santa Brigida mine which sustained the town until it gave out. It is marked by three large ovens with tall pyramid roofs. These were constructed by the Jesuits to work ore from the mine.Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 12–13 The Ruta Arqueológica (Archeological Route) links the two pre-Hispanic sites of Plazuelas and Peralta which are currently open to visitors with two others which are scheduled to be opened sometime in the future: La Virgen de la Cañada in San Miguel de Allende and El Cóporo in Ocampo.Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 22–23\n",

      "The Ruta de los Conventos or Monastery Route is concentrated in the south of the state, where a number of large religious complexes were built in the early colonial period for evangelization purposes. The Agustino de San Pablo Church and Monastery is located in Yuriria founded by the Augustinians who arrived from Michoacán in the 16th century. It is a monumental fortress-like construction designed by Friar Diego de Chávez y Alvarado and Pedro del Toro and constructed in an area with relatively little population. The monastery became a center from which missionaries would be trained and then sent forth and its size and battlements helped to protect it from Chichimeca attacks. The church retains its original function and Plateresque facade, but the monastery area has been converted into a museum. The Las Capucinas Church and Convent is in Salvatierra and is one of only three complexes built for nuns in the entire state during the colonial period. It has a fortress like appearance and its construction is attributed to Joaquin de Heredia, of the San Carlos Academy. During the Porfirio Díaz presidency, the convent was used as a Civil Hospital and later as a school, which still remains with the name of Colegio José María Morelos. The San Francisco Church and Monastery is in Acámbaro and built between 1734 and 1743. Its facade is Baroque of light pink stone. Inside, the church contains one of the most notable main altars in the Bajio region. It is Neoclassical built of gray and pink stone with gilded details, with an image of the Virgen María Refugio de Pecadores (Virgin Mary Refuge of Sinners), which is replica of an image in Zacatecas.Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 30\n",
